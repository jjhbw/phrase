{"body":"So I downloaded this app expecting to create another number, but as soon as i entered in my personal number along with a password, the app wouldn\u2019t let me go any further. All it said was \u201ccreate account\u201d and so i clicked that and nothing happened. I closed the app and tried it multiple times with different passwords and received the same results. This app sounds like a cool idea, but my experiences with this one were not positive.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I was disappointed when they changed to a paid model and charged so much for the service. But given that it is now a paid service, I expect that the functionality and user experience to be much better. Navigating between missed calls, texts, and voicemail is frustrating. More than half the time I tap on something I\u2019m accidentally calling the contact I meant to just check texts of voicemail on. Please improve this app. Call quality is also intermittent, especially on data. I really want this app to work well as I use it for my business line.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

I\u2019m getting multiple calls a day from the same telemarketer. It\u2019s getting annoying real fast. So beware. Seems like they sell your number.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I just got this app yesterday and subscribed to it but it is now asking me to choose another number because the number i had was inactive and it has been canceled......this doesn\u2019t make sence,this means i won be able to get reply from the people i texted yesterday because the number i texted the from has been deactivated","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"This is a really good app for messages and phone calls the only down side is that while driving you will have to hold to the to your ear or have it on speaker because they don\u2019t have the capability to connect to the cars Bluetooth which a big bummer for me besides that it works great.","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I have used the line for over a year and the one improvement that I would suggest is the you could do a search of words and numbers to find info or to allow you to recall a persons info. Without having to look thru individual contacts to find info.\n\nThis still has not been done it is needed or I am leaving. It is simple to ad a search feature my regular line has it. Add it and you are a 5 star app","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The app works about 90% of the time. Sometimes if you receive a call the caller ID will say Incoming Sideline Call instead of the contact that is saved. Also the app doesn\u2019t support GIFs and only shows them in an image mode. You also cannot like someone\u2019s message like you can on other platforms. I think if they can work on these 3 things the app would simply be perfect. I\u2019m hoping we can get this resolved in a future update.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I really wanted to give Sideline a shot but I can't even get pass conforming my real number. I've tried multiple times but for some reason the sideline number won't activate because I can't confirm. I'll enter my iPhone number and a password, click confirm and then nothing happens.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"UPDATE: This app constantly drops calls and no longer has AUTO TEXT REPLY to calls or texts. It\u2019s gone downhill and fast. And also NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. NONE. No one will call you or respond to your online requests for help - THEY KNOW THEIR APP IS BROKEN.\n\nOriginal: \nFor the first month the app was working okay. A huge DOWNSIDE is it doesn't separate your contacts so when you save a sideline contact it goes into your personal iOS contact list without ANY ability to separate. The update in August 6 prevented all new calls from being logged in the app - no texts, no missed calls, no made calls. So essentially it's been destroyed by a bad update and by engineers who clearly didn't QA the roll out. sad for pinger. And they have no customer support - over the phone so it takes 7 hours and 3 days to find a problem and NOT to fix it.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I downloaded this app to keep my personal and work relations separate. I\u2019m using it on my iPhone XS Max. I'm still on the 7 day trial. I am keeping the subscription since im already giving everyone the new number. The only problem I have with this app that it still keeps all your contacts together \ud83d\ude44. This app would be awesome if it had it own separate contact log within the app. So now I have to put \"SL\u201d in front of all my contacts that I\u2019m using sideline with so I don\u2019t get confused with my personal contacts. Basically I have this app so when I\u2019m on Vacation, I can just just send all my Sideline contacts to Voicemail and not be bothered.and still be able to receive my personal calls without carrying 2 phones with me all the time. So Plz Fix The Contacts to separate them. Then this app be 5 Stars \ud83d\ude09","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"This app works about 60% of the time it is glitchy the rest of the time. None of my billing information changed but somehow randomly I have to contact Apple support and billing to fix something that never changed. I did some research and found out this is something that a ton of people had to do and it appears to be an error on the developer side. However, instead of helping their customers or working through it, they pass the buck and customer service is completely unhelpful and unsupportive. \n\nIt was a great app when it was free because it made up for the lack of customer support in the glitchiness of the app. Now that it\u2019s paid, it\u2019s really not worth the money. There are a lot of other apps at a similar price point that have much better customer service, work better\/more consistently and have better features and benefits. \n\nAs a matter of fact, you can get true voip software for about the same price or slightly more and it functions as a full blown phone system.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

Calls used to come in as a sideline incoming call from your regular phone and didn\u2019t go through the app. Now that the calls come through the app I\u2019ve had a myriad of issues such as missing calls because the ringtones through the app aren\u2019t loud enough, I can\u2019t 3-way call now because of the calls going through the app, callers can\u2019t hear me as well and constantly ask if I have them on speaker, etc. I HATE this update.

I can automatically respond to clients when my hands are tied with another task, and the best part....I only have to lug around one phone! Having my personal and professional life both available in one device is truly fantastic. \n\nMy only issue has been the occasional dead zone for my service provider, but I live in a very rural area, and can\u2019t entirely blame that on the app. \n\nGreat product and easy to use!","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}

Some people reviewing this app don\u2019t seem like they understand the basics of business or technology.  \n\nHaving said that, my one criticism of the app is the slight delay during a call, and it seems to be all calls.  There is a really slight .5 second delay that often has me talking over other people or vice versa.   \n\nThe on thing lacking is an app for the Apple Watch.  I would gladly pay $2 more a month if they had an app available for the Apple Watch so I could leave my phone at home or in the car and go to the gym and\/or walk around my house knowing important calls or texts are available to be addressed or ignored.\n\nThanks, Guys and Gals","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}

My calls are no longer coming through on VPN, WiFi or cellular. I just get a notification 1 second after the call to let mw know that I missed it. I haven't been able to answer a Sideline incoming call in weeks.  Text are still fine, but it is definitely not an app for business callers looking to receive calls. There is no call forwarding feature, so you are guaranteed to loose roughly 3\/4 or your incoming calls even if you have full service or connected to 400mb wifi (This calculation is based on my experience on 6 different phones ranging from 5c to XsMax) i was told 3 months ago it is a temporary problem, which will is be fixed by 1\/1\/19 its now 1\/14\/18 i am waiting until the end of month, hoping to see the improvements promised.

As a business owner myself, I understand how things works and how customers should be treated. The support was so terrible they just pointed me to the Apple Store.

The idea that you can have a \u201cteam number\u201d is great until some of the options are disabled once activated is asinine! \n\nAt this point, i feel like I will miss out on business calls because calls occasionally don\u2019t come through or a SPAM call comes through first.

I Got this app to have a second number so I could run my business off of it and still have my personal line.\n I wasn\u2019t quite sure how I was going to like it but after the first month I was sold on it. I\u2019ve had it for about two years now and have switched from a couple different phones as I have upgraded and I haven\u2019t had any problems switching over.\n Anytime that I have had a tiny issue they have responded within a few minutes and have fixed the problem a few minutes there after.\n I have told many of my friends and coworkers about Sideline and they are using it also. I also noticed that I don\u2019t get any spam calls on this number so somehow spam doesn\u2019t recognize it which is a plus.\n One thing about it that I don\u2019t like is that when I\u2019m filling out certain applications online such as bank accounts and have to leave a phone number, they don\u2019t except this phone number they say it is a faulty number but that\u2019s OK I\u2019ve used this number for two years and couldn\u2019t want anything more thank you sideline!!","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is absolutely terrible. It charged me regardless which whatever, it\u2019s only 9.99 + tax so whatever, I will eat the cost no problem. But, where I then get super frustrated is the fact that the app doesn\u2019t work! I can call out using my 2nd number through this app BUT when people call me, it will just ring until it gets to voicemail but, never comes up or allows me to answer on my end. I can only see after the fact that I had missed a call. So, it\u2019s basically worthless! I\u2019m a technician for a living so it\u2019s not like my notifications aren\u2019t enabled or, I don\u2019t know what it is I am doing. It will notify me AFTER the fact that I missed a call or that I have a VM but, It never rings on my end nor am I able to answer. \n\nWhat a waste of money. If you\u2019re looking to do a subscription with them, don\u2019t. It\u2019s not reliable and doesn\u2019t work so save or money or use it elsewhere for an app that actually works.

Due to my business it is very helpful to have another phone # ready as clients are often quick to dismiss my initial calls. Annonimity is ideal, this was marketed as just that, a second anonymous number you can change at anytime. Well it's never been anonymous, and it's not cheap. But this is what pisses me off. I resolved to let go of the app after this one month renewal simply to let people know I wag going to be changing numbers. However, I must've missed the reminder altogether (if there even was one) to let me know my time was running short.  I get notified my Subscription has run out and then I can renew at the advertised rates. however, this is what gets me, I cannot access my old text or call list. Essentially RANSOMING MY PAST CONVERSATIONS TO ME!  That is the kind of customer service that makes me hate her company and pray for their downfall. It\u2019s absolute greed and a \"screw the customer-they'll pay it cuz we'll make it hell for them to do anything about it attitude!\" It's just sad and disgusting when companies realize they just don't have the market growth to continue within their present budget and end up crumbling because they tried to bleed their customers just one time too much. \n\nBottom line, have a functioning product that's reliable at a fair price and has some perks, is not what this company wants. They want your subjugation to their owning your second (not always functioning live) and they will play dirty to get as much of your money as possible. \n\nBUYER BEWARE. \n\nOh, I'd you're on the phone and get a call on the sideline number, it won't tell you who it is and you better answer it because sideline will be missing that call from its log and your phones log will simply day \"incoming sideline call\" with no way to find out who called. I shouldn't have to say this, but that's bad business. \n\nI am removing one I am able to harass enough people to give me back my access to my old call log and messages.

I was stunned to find out they were receiving random phone numbers when I used my Sideline Phone Number! I did more research and found out that the reason a lot of current and new customers did not answer or reply to my phone calls was because they were receiving random out of state phone numbers on their caller ID\u2019s and not my personal business number I was told I had when buying this app. Sidelines App has cost me countless hours of time, new and existing customers, lost revenue, and all the $$$$ invested in business cards, flyers, banners and signs with my number that was being Re-routed as as a different number to customers caller ID\u2019s on there phone and many customers numbers I had saved said they thought it was spam \/ telemarketers when I would call due to it always being a random out of state area code \/ phone number they would receive when I called them.

Now that I\u2019ve uninstalled the app I continue to get these calls. So unnecessary. Would rate 0 stars if possible.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"This app is easy to use and makes my life easier because I can separate my personal calls and messages from my business related conversation. There are something I feel that can be improved on:\n\n1. Sometimes I get double notifications, one from my device indicating I missed a call and another from the sideline app. Sometimes I get missed call notification from my device only and other times from sideline only. \n\n2. It would be nice that if I tap on missed called (ones from sideline)from the phone app and it would automatically open the sideline app and call.\n\n3. My most desired feature is the ability to delete multiple conversations at once\u2019s or all together instead of swiping each individual conversation to delete.\n\n4. It would be nice to separate call logs and text logs within the sideline app.\n\nOther than that I think the app runs smooth and it works for my business needs.","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I was a paid subscriber from last year and continuing .. when its a free service it really doesnt matter anout the service and all , but when the app was a paid subscription and they are taking 100$ annually , they suppose to be pro active with the app . It was not functioning properly as i cant answer incoming calls . And there text service is horrible . \nThey have to fix this issue as this was open from long time . If we dnt like the service tgere is no option of refund . \nBetter try for line2 or some other app .","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app works horribly w I watch , if the phone isn\u2019t near it will not work and even then most of the time the call drops or shuts off once you pick up , you can\u2019t respond by texts or even any actual control of this app fr iwatch and is very annoying for those that use the new iwatch series 4 as a stand alone phone\/watch. Sideline will not work if the main iPhone is not around. And their caller id is horrendous, at times will just announce phone numbers instead of the contact name in your contacts??? As a paid subscriber I expect better service than this and these issues need to be addressed!!!!","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I love my Sideline! I used to carry an extra phone for business, I love having two phone lines and one phone now! And the phone logs are totally separate which keeps my business and personal lives separated, so I can have an automated message for calls on my business line and still pick up regular phone calls on my personal line. One problem I have had, which is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5, on the rare occasion I will get some interference on my line the clients can\u2019t hear but is very loud on my end. Other than that this is been a great service for the price!","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}

Automated systems.\n\nI also receive static when receiving calls and the ability to switch to a Bluetooth or out of it is seriously impaired. \n\nHopefully some spam blockers can be added to this service and the Bluetooth functionality can be greatly improved, otherwise it\u2019s gonna be a no go for me.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Thanks for a great app with great customer service! Super glad I joined during your early stages and saw it grow to what it is now...would love to see an updated ability to have multiple \"main lines\" under one login account vs being limited to one main line and team extensions, i currently maintain 3 phone lines: 1. My main carrier line 2. my SideLine and 3. a second biz line via the \"Digits\" app by T-Mobile which isnt as good of an app as SideLine is...Wish I can just use SideLine only no matter how many lines I'm paying for. Also, would love to see some features available from the SuperPhone app like the automated \"follow-up messages\" to keep in touch with contacts that I havent spoken to in a while to build strong relationships, having that incorporated into SideLine's functionality for better business networking would be a game changer...meanwhile, I'm very happy with my SideLine!\n\nThanks \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I hate writing bad reviews but this is just horrible! I downloaded the app and my free trial started before I picked a number.

{"body":"I ported my number over from google voice a couple years ago and was initially happy. A couple things have really started to mess me up lately:\n1) when you switch to a team number you can\u2019t text message from the web. This was a cool feature that\u2019s not available to me any longer.\n2) if you have a ported number and switch to teams you can\u2019t switch back. So no web messaging available maybe ever?\n3) when they recently upgraded to iOS 12 the app failed to function for over half a day, meaning I had no phone at all for this time. This cost me hundreds in lost business, but though I asked for a compensation in subscription time for lost revenue they ignored the request. \n4) the app is generally buggy and will often display without a text box to type in, needs to be killed and reloaded with some frequency","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"My experience was good. After the trial period. I lost connections with my internet along with the phone number. I contacted them via email. They resolved my issue in a timely manner. The issue was resolved before they responded to my email. So far everything is back to normal. It is scary to give out your new number and cannot be contacted, or call out. I think this company work hard on solving issues. Hope this helps you decide.","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}

I don\u2019t know what caused you them to start charging but now there privacy policy has changed\/ updated yet again stating that a 8.99 fee is beginning . Not happy at all .

When someone calls, you can see the phone number of the caller, but it doesn\u2019t show the contact name. Because it\u2019s 2018 and no one memorizes phone numbers, I can\u2019t tell who is calling.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

Carriers don\u2019t even step in and lock your device from \u201cany\u201d functionality, because you can no longer afford their service.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Love this app! Really helps in separating business from personal calls. However for a payed app it should definitely be able to work more smoothly, has some glitches that need fixing (caller ID issue, quality of pictures). \n\nWould also love if a broadcast feature can be added to message many people at once since this app is designed for business use can be very helpful to send a mass text to many clients\/customers.","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Don\u2019t update. Support is over promising an update and results. Need to test before you post an update. Engineers need to test. I pay for this app too. Real sad case. If it was a ninja slice game then I wouldn\u2019t care. This is an text and phone app that I use for business. The porting process takes 5-7 days to anyone because they are listed as a VOIP company! Go get the dual sim iPhone and eliminate this app.  Dual SIM future!","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Seems like tech issues on a constant basis.  After time sideline does not ring on its line but rings with iPhone ring not the sideline ring. Messages come thru in text but when I try to play no playback.  Tech support will always say to remove app and reinstall. \nGreat for my business needs however I get frustrated with the tech issues I keep experiencing for paying for an app.\n\nAlso, I have a primary brand that I need to keep separate from the secondary brand that the sideline phone calls come to.  At times the sideline calls are coming to my iPhone directly (primary brand number) and they are getting that number\/ message and either leaving messages there or I am picking up thinking it\u2019s my primary brand calling.  Not good!!!  This is really a huge error when you have two brands and trying to keep them separate for business reasons. I wish they would find a solution besides \u2018remove the app and reinstall\u2019 as then it\u2019s too late!!!","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

But one quick email to sideline, and Aaron over at Sideline fixed my issue within a 24hr period. Now this app is rock solid! (Thanks Aaron!!!)\n\nIf you are having an issue I would recommend asking for Aaron. He was super helpful and fixed all my problems.","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Well you do get a second line, but you might not be able to use it for certain things.  Videos must be downloaded to be played.  Pics of expanded to full screen lock the app and it must be restarted.\n\nMy biggest complaint is there long message support or lack of it.  Any message over a 2 lines is broken up and sent to the recipient in multiple out of order texts.  Basically a jigsaw puzzle to read.  If you are trying to use this for business you will look like and idiot to your customers until they fix this.  As of 8\/30\/18 this is still an issue and been this way for months.  Scan the reviews, there are several users stating this.\n\nSupport sends you the same solution regardless of the problem you report:  delete and reinstall the app, reboot.  Was even told to wipe the phone once.  Responses other than that are at least a day between.  \n\nShouldn\u2019t be this difficult to use.  I\u2019m a paid user too.\n\nUpdate: responded to the developer request, got yet another support call opened, still no answers on these serious issues they claim to have information on.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I keep my Sideline active as my direct business line with its own ringtone, so when ever I hear it I know to pick up. The only thing it doesn\u2019t do is tell me who, from my address book, is calling. I just see a number so it\u2019s kind of like I\u2019m blind when I pick up the phone. Same with texts... it\u2019s embarrassing to have to ask your boss or client who they are in text when you can\u2019t tell by the number. Other than that though, it\u2019s great!","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"I use the sideline number for my business calls. My company suggests a second phone, a work phone but I barely remember to carry one. The calls are always clear unlike a different service we tried before. The text interface works great. I love the options to auto reply, and voice to text.  The only thing I wish could be improved is, I can not use the sideline on my Apple Watch series 3. I can see a call is coming in, but can not answer it and I can see and read a text but can not reply. If that is something sideline could add I\u2019d be sold for life. Aside from the watch, which i am not even sure sideline has control over this app has helped me with my job.","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}

In my business I don\u2019t save clients names all the time so I depend on the search bar to find people or conversations, or sometimes i will look for specific conversations but cant find it because calls and txts are combined. Little things like that would make this app worth so much more","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}

I need to be able to make calls.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The app works fine for me, I mostly don't even mind having to pay for it because it's functional- except that it lacks one of the major things I want it to do. I use it as a separate number to deal with a whole separate part of my life; but the only way I can save numbers is to save them to my main contacts. I want to be able to have my sideline numbers in sideline only and to keep everything totally separate. Instead I have to guess who everyone is from text convo context because I can't add names to the conversations. If I found another app that did the sane things but let me have a contacts list I would jump ship instantly.\n\nUpdate, this still isn't a feature and I drove 40 min out of my way for no reason today because of a message that was delivered 2 hours late. So glad I'm paying for this app now. I'm counting the days til a competitor comes up with a working version of this so I can switch.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I purchased the Sideline app on 30 July 2016 to have a second number, besides business and personal, to give out to people who I didn\u2019t want to give me a personal number to yet. Had no issues when come September 2017 they informed users they had to subscribe in order to use it for $70 a the year. I had liked it so far and figured, \u201cwhat the hell\u201c.\n\nThe first six months I have the app, I got received voice messages from an automated system through a prison looking to reach someone. After sharing the app with others they mentioned that it was a burner number.\n\nOn 16 October 2017, I purchased a VPN app to protect the privacy and security of my devices. Beginning sometime around the second quarter of this year, the app started not sending messages. Troubleshooting led to the fact that it wouldn\u2019t send messages many times when the VPN was on, as well as phone service did not work at all. Even with the VPN off, a couple times it still made me retry sending the text I was attempting to send on WiFi.\n\nWith it happening more and more on the VPN,  and the fact that I attempted to use the phone number as a contact for GOOGLE I was not allowed, I have chosen not to re-subscribe to this app which ends on the 14 September 2018. Me not being able to use as a contact number for things, tells me that people were correct in the fact that this is a burner number. \n\nIn contacting the company sharing about not being able to use as contacts with some companies, never addressed in responses back, as well as that they are jeopardizing my privacy and security to being told that they do care about customers privacy and security but don\u2019t allow VPNs for the reasons they gave. When responded that it is an oxymoron statement, to be told again the reasons they don\u2019t allow and they do care about customers privacy and security. There is ABSOLUTELY NO reason any app or someone needs someone\u2019s private IPN, unless they are using for it mischievous reason.\n\nWhile great to have another number, the fact that some companies don\u2019t accept to be used as a phone number, and that in order to use one must jeopardize their privacy and security it is not worth it any more. If the app was free, it would be one thing. Charging $70\/year for a number that can\u2019t be give for contact to many, and forcing me to release private information unnecessary for running an app it is not worth the cost when my privacy and security are at risk.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to point out that while I had to turn off the VPN to sent or call, never had an issue with texts or calls coming in.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

I hope you are having a great day so far.\n\nI see that your subscription was recently cancelled due to a missed payment, and you set up a new subscription. The old subscription option of $5.99 is no longer available as it was an older subscription option, so this was lost when the payment was missed and cannot be added back. I am sorry to be the bearer of this bad news. \nHere is the proof!

{"body":"I use Sideline for online purchases requiring contact info. Also perfect for food carry-out pickups. Shopping for a car (or any face to face purchase) is\/was so much less annoying since calls go to Voicemail. \n\nSince cellphone numbers are becoming unique personal identifiers, Sideline completely insulates my true identity. For whatever reason I rarely receive cold or \u201cRobo\u201d calls. And because I have set my iPhone up such that any caller not in my Contacts doesn\u2019t ring and goes straight to Voicemail, the convenience quotient is very high. \n\nI was an early adopter and have to say that it is difficult to find a support team on any app (or PC software) that has been more responsive. I never wait more than 24 hours and communication is always professional, prompt and clear.","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Love that I can use this app for business calls, because I don\u2019t answer random numbers to my personal line. However there are ongoing issues with texts and web messaging. Any texts longer than a sentence or so breaks apart and out of order, so my clients can\u2019t understand what I\u2019m saying. Same goes for incoming messages. Lots of \u201cread\u201d messages stay marked as \u201cunread\u201d after opening and replying. Web messaging often doesn\u2019t load and old messages disappear.\n\nOnce my year subscription is up, I\u2019ll be looking elsewhere. I\u2019ve reached out for tech support and they want my clients to screenshot and send copies of texts, and it\u2019s incredibly unprofessional. They refuse to offer any type of credit for lack of app working. I\u2019ve had to go back to using my personal line after initial contact, almost making it a complete waste of money. \n\nI so wish they could figure out these bugs...it has wonderful potential but I don\u2019t have the time to be their QA assistant and pay to do so.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"We use Sideline to take calls for a 2nd smaller business that we operate.  It generally integrates well with our contact list, identifies callers if in our contacts (as opposed to Google Voice which does not) and texts smoothly as expected.  Voice message to text conversion is reasonably accurate as well.\n\nHowever, there are 2 drawbacks that we have found to be issues for our business use:\n\n1) When sending pictures via text, the photo library is limited to just a few recent pictures.  If you have pictures that are older, perhaps 2-3 weeks prior to your attempted message, you may not be able to select them to send.  There is a work-around that we found by taking screenshots of those pictures in order to make them more current and available to choose from.  Just causes us extra time to perform.\n\n2) We recently needed to print a text conversation that had transpired over 2 months time.  We found that there is no option to print texts from Sideline at this time.  We tried a couple of different apps for printing texts, but could not find one that made the SMS texts specifically from Sideline available.  Apparently this has been requested by many users for over a year, but there has been no development for this need or even a reasonable response from the  Sideline developers.  If you need to print texts for business use (ie - reimbursement or legal needs), this may not be the app to use.\n\nOther than these 2 functionality issues, we have found Sideline to be a useful tool for our 2nd business.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"The biggest reason for me getting this app was because in the description it shows the ability to create a \u201cvanity number\u201d which I specifically wanted for my business. After downloading, I found out that this option is not truly available. On top of that, suggestions per the users have to be voted on by others in order for it to be considered. If you advertise the ability to create a vanity number, then just make sure it\u2019s real information. I\u2019m going to give it a shot, but hopefully soon, they\u2019ll be able to do as promoted.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This is one of my favorite apps, no need for a second phone and no need for adding a second line to your phone bills!","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"It worked better before I had to pay for it. First it was free, got my business cards with that number, then I had to pay $70 to keep that number. Now it drops calls, people can barely hear me, it rings only one time when a call comes through. The only thing I like about it is the text voicemail feature, which doesn\u2019t work well because it types the wrong message but it\u2019s a good feature. If not for that, I would have given it a negative two stars rather than two. I will definitely not be renewing.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Been using it for a year. Sometimes freezes, but in overall the best 2nd number app so far. It would be great if developer adds search bar like in iphone. Most of the time I dont save the contacts, but still need the customers messages wanting to book or who already booked specific date. With search bar I could easily find those, without scrolling and checking each message thread. I get at least 5 new customer requests daily.","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"The one thing I truly enjoyed about Sideline, was the fact, All Business text was never deleted unless you deleted them yourself. Apparently, we no longer have that option, after that last update, all business texted and phone number are gone without warning. Now l have no record of nothing, l lost pictures, messages and phone numbers, everything. Absolutely heartbreaking and devastating, what a waste.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I had to say hello at least twice before the person who called me could hear me. There was not an immediate connection like my main line and was not a great impression for incoming business calls.

Other than that, worked fine.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I manage a very large group of doctors & mid-level providers in several hospitals, & I used to have to carry 2 cell phones every day. \n\nSideline lets me use my personal *phone* without utilizing my personal *cell number*. AND you get to select the number you want to use. \n\nImprovements I would like to see:\n - if you\u2019re in a text message, there\u2019s no number notification in the left corner to show you there are other text messages waiting \n - there is a lag in the calls, no matter how fast your internet speed is. You don\u2019t hear the lag, but there\u2019s a delay in the other person hearing you, so the conversation can get very confusing very quickly. \n - you can\u2019t send GIFs in messaging. This is a small issue, but would be a nice addition. \n\nOtherwise this is a great app, very dependable, and I use it every single day!","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"I started using this as a free app. It was worth what I paid for it.   Then in October it went to $9.99 a month. I looked at other plans and said sure I will try.  They said if I stay for one month and don\u2019t like it I could port for free.  Shocking had to pay $19.99 to port. \n\nAs talked about from other people calls don\u2019t come through, they have issues with voicemail.  Try to get support they don\u2019t read what you send they send back faq pages you have already seen and read. \n\nIt seems like trained monkeys could do that and have a better response.  I paid their fee to port and out of the $60.00 for service I paid them it will be the best money I spent. \n\nThey never forward calls from the same number so you never know if it a call from sideline coming in or a scam call. I have talked to more scammers in the last 6 months than ever. \n\nI hope that you look at this and pass this app by. \n\nI agree that they hold numbers hostage as reported by others. \n\nPs of the developer wants to respond the only response I want is a full refund.  Your product is junk. The app crash all the time. It is a joke.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"When I heard about this app, I was skeptical wether or not I should try it or not but when I read the apps usage and in store purchases I was like okay! I\u2019ll try it since it\u2019s free. Well I downloaded the app and it took a few days to get the app going because when I would pick a number for the app it would say I\u2019m already registered and there\u2019s to many attempts anyway long story short I sent a email explaining and sideline fixed the issue but now they want me to pay monthly fees. No thanks","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I really want to like this app. If it worked properly it would be well worth the monthly subscription. \n\nUnfortunately, if I don\u2019t answer a call to my sideline number it will go to to my personal voicemail about half the time. \n\nI\u2019ve tried all sorts of different settings to no avail. Support hasn\u2019t been able to find a solution to the issue. \n\nI\u2019ve been using the app for almost a year but I\u2019m going to have to go back to carrying a second phone for business :(","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

I am blind, using my iPhone with speech, so I sometimes have trouble accessing my voicemail, and cannot find how to put it on do not disturb, but, if you can help with that, the App is excellent!! I also love being able to turn on call forwarding when I can't answer calls, but still can answer if I get calls on my regular number. This App works so much better than others I've tried.

{"body":"Works just fine after I made the suggestions you gave me of turning off voip. Thank you.\n\nI used this app prior to it becoming a paid for app, service was pretty good.

I have yet to have a descent conference call.","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"It\u2019s a shame that I had to edit my review yet again. False advertising. They have contacted me through email. It states right on the home page of their website. \u201cAuto attendant coming by soon\u201d I couldn\u2019t get a date out of them. Now they say that they are never bringing auto attendant to a single line. Clearly a class action law suit waiting to happen from all their preexisting paid customer. \nOn the plus side. The static has gone away and it works well now. I really think it works great now. \n\nFrom a business view. Sound quality is better than Ring Central. Not as clear as Vonage. Almost sounds like a non-digital call. I find myself struggling to hear the other party. What really kills the app. is Auto-Attendant is \u201cComing soon\u201d or you have to buy two lines\ud83e\udd14.  If I wanted that I would stick with VoIP.  Without auto-attendant people will think they are calling a personal cell phone and not a business.\n  Price is great. Updated: On the app. It states $2.99 but it\u2019s included with the monthly charge. (Must be left over from the free days of this app)Most of the cost is on the phone carrier. Considering I\u2019m burning minutes that get wasted anyways. \nThe cool feature is the auto missed call text with picture or logo. \nSo we will see! This could cut out another profit sucking expense. If I don\u2019t loose any business!","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Still no fix! Yes you have heard it from several users! \nI\u2019ve contacted sideline customer service about a dozen times. They have not updated their app to work well with the iPhone X or with Apple 11.0 updates or newer. It is very slow. It takes about 5-6 app restart to be able to use. I\u2019ve tried in several iPhone X, 8, and 7. Does not work like it use to before Apple update. The only phones it works right, is on an iPhone with 10.0 or older. Defeats the purpose of paying and having the app. Please fix, or give me my money back!!!","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I like this app. It replaces my work phone and works perfectly. The only criticism is the sorting order of the contacts.  Some contacts are sorted by first name. Some by last name.

{"body":"Caller ID hit or miss. Sound quality was ok. Outrageous charges to take your number is sad. In addition after you do break free from the overpriced service, they log you out of the service and you lose all your messages you had saved. This is pitiful!

Not after the way they keep damaging their relationships with the customer.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"This app was pretty decent, with a few dropped calls. Recently, the caller id quit working. It only says \"sideline incoming call\". Calls were also beginning to drop. I use this as a business line. On top of all that now they want to charge for an app, that's less than 80% functional, uses my cell data\/wifi services I purchase from a provider. If that's the case I could purchase an additional line for $10. The way sideline broke the news to current app users was through an ad\/text message. So if you missed it, oh well. I prefer to go with an app I know I have to pay for upfront vs. a text from a free app. This action reminds me of how Netflix treated their customers by quickly increasing their prices, if I'm not mistaken they are still trying to recover. I have also been reading where they are charging $20 to port your number out. Well I brought MY number to sideline, with that being said if I am charged to port MY number out, I will have to take further actions, because it was my number to begin with. This is one of those apps you have to read the fine print. Be cautious with this app.\n\nUpdate: I decided to try it out. It was ok, not like it was but ok. Since this most recent update, the app crashes ALL the time! This is a business number. Meaning I get paid with my business!!!! If you charge for an app make sure it works! My business is just as important as this app!!","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"i tried it for 7days and i have to say i was highly impressed. I am sure and certain its worth the $10\/month fee. What i like most is their customer service, quick response and live chat.

{"body":"Issues with caller ID- sometimes it shows up and sometimes it doesn't. This is a big issue for me because I hate picking up calls when I don't know who it is. \n\nPicture scrolling doesn't work- if someone texts you more than one picture, you can only look at one at a time. This gets very annoying if you want to look back at old pictures someone texted you, you can only look at one at a time, and you need to scroll all the way back up in your messages to see the next one. \n\nI will really be reconsidering paying for a second year subscription unless they fix these two issue. I would give this app a 5 star if it weren't for these issues.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I started using this app when it was free as a local business number. When it was free it was great and I could tolerate when things glitched. It was free after all so I couldn\u2019t really complain. FF to October it became a subscription based app and that\u2019s where all the problems began. We signed up and immediately started having issues. Things from billing, calls not coming in, calls not going out and most of all LACK of customer service. \n\nAfter 2 weeks in December and 2 weeks now in February we were barely being able to get any customer support. We decided to pay a bit more money for another app that provides better service AND has an actual person to speak with if any issues arise. The worse part was having to pay an additional full month of service + pay to port out our number and being charged 4x by iTunes. YES 4 TIMES! You have to go through iTunes and hope their app recognizes what you\u2019re doing. They can\u2019t even process their own payments right then want to drop that dead monkey on apples lap. Because of that they tried to hold our phone number hostage. \n\nWe will not recommend this service to anyone and now have to see how we will get back all the overages they robbed us of.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

This really is a great service especially in my line of work but I can't justify paying a monthly service charge for it.\n\nSo I\u2019m updating my review today and reading through the \u201clatest\u201d reviews.

{"body":"Honestly with my work it\u2019s required to have a link or some form of way to access this website so that i can see my schedule. But this app almost makes me wish we could use hotschedules or borderline switch jobs. There\u2019s multiple times where I\u2019m force logged out and forced into reseting my passwords, Do the password right and am still locked out, Along with multiple other bugs. The problem is this isn\u2019t some game on the app store, this is a work related app and effects my lively-hood. If this app screws up and i can\u2019t find my schedule in time i could be considered a no call no show and lose the job. This app along with the website have failed me many times, over all i advise against it. At the very least if it\u2019s required like it is for my job, please don\u2019t waste your time or money on the app. A normal case scenario you have to call in and find out yourself making it useless, and as i said before, worst case you\u2019re looking for a new job.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"If i could give it no star i would. Ive had nothing but problems wasted 3 hours just trying to sign into it and all i want is to see my schedule.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Since they revamped the software I\u2019ve had nothing but problems. Can not view my schedule, have to go online, the site recommends I buy the app to view, I did and it\u2019s worthless. The few times, and seriously, the few times I\u2019ve been able to see my schedule it doesn\u2019t sync to my calendar.  New look is confusing on days you work.  You can not ask for more than one day off at a time, you have to ask for each day off, instead of from 1-5 off.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I think it\u2019s absolutely pathetic that I had to spend money to download this app because the website continues to glitch and not allow you to load it\/log in, and the app is borderline worthless. It has my schedule on there (which is on the email I get as well so no bonus points for that), but it doesn\u2019t lay out a clear way to contact managers which is the number one thing I wanted. It\u2019s also not very user friendly. Don\u2019t waste your money.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

No matter what day I choose. Though on my main \u201cschedule\u201d page, it says differently. That could seriously cause issues and cause employees to show up for the wrong shifts \/ not show up at all. The fact that I had to PAY for this app to view my schedule you would really think it would be a better less confusing system... please fix this.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"99% of the time I\u2019ll pick up a shift that I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m working on a Thursday night but then after my shift gets approved I go back into the app I reread it and it says I\u2019m working Friday. The app is displayed so confusing and I always get my shifts mixed up because the way the app is displayed makes it look like I\u2019m working one day but instead I\u2019m working the next day. Please StaffLinq make it easier to read so I don\u2019t get my shifts mixed up anymore :(","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"It\u2019s looks a lot better and navigate a smoother, but now I can\u2019t see the in\/out times for the people I work with like I could before and it\u2019s really annoying to have to select the calendar and then chose location just to see who works for the day, you have to do that every single time you want to view the full staff schedule for the day!! Please fix!!","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I\u2019ve had the app for 3 years. I feel like in 2018 it shouldn\u2019t of taken that long to get a decent up to date app. But alas we finally got a new updated version. Not to shabby. Still wish it was a bit more modernized.","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"The new layout of the app had me misreading my schedule twice now. You have no idea who\u2019s working with you on your shift so you don\u2019t know who you can ask to cover for you. Navigating this design is an absolute mess. Very disappointed my company decided to go with this instead of HotSchedules","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

I think they need couple of tweaks and they will move from good to really good.","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}

Half the time the app doesn\u2019t even sync up with the online schedule so when I try to pick up or release a shift my manager doesn\u2019t even get notified.

I WISH I COULD. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 there\u2019s no way to send out a mass message to all servers, like a \u201chey I can\u2019t work Thursday.. could anyone work for me?\u201d Unless I want to go through and individually message everyone. This isn\u2019t even the beginning of my list of complaints for this app. I\u2019m also curious as to who owns this app because I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s somebody that also partners with Metro Diner.. and I just expect more out of them. We make all these changes and I can\u2019t wait to see a Metro Times with the header \u201cWe No Longer Use Stafflinq!!\u201d because this is pathetic.

Spent $2.99 because the company I work for switched to this scheduling program and I wish I hadn't bought it.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The only convenient thing about this app is that I don't have to sign in every time. Everything else is worse than the actual website. It won't let me request shifts. The staff schedule has no details or order to it.  I end up signing into the website because it's ease of use and everything works.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The fact that we have to pay $3 to see our schedule is very upsetting to me.\nThis is a clunky, poorly built app. \nThe most annoying part is that it gives the numerical date without saying \"Thursday\" or \"Sunday\"\nSo I know I work two weeks away on the 28th, but then I need to check a calendar to see what day of the week it is.\nI hate this app almost as much as I hate the company who makes me check my schedule on it!","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"It is cool that they finally have an app for it but it should definitely be free, it's not that great of an app. The app itself is very slow and how things are displayed is kind of junky; I don't know if that's just because it's an initial start up app and it doesn't have a lot of perks yet or what but hopefully they upgrade it soon and fix more of the bugs.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

I will never ever throw my money away on a subscription model there are still way too many companies that offer full one time paid versions of similar apps or software.  When Adobe went to subscription model I went to Affinity Photo one time purchase and its excellent.  People wake up don\u2019t throw your money away year after year on a subscription payment.  A company can\u2019t survive unless they have customers. You feel me.  I downloaded it and after reading the reviews I immediately deleted it and contacted Apple Support and my AMEX Card to inform them if I am charge to do a refund charge back.  The company is very deceitful.  Why do they say the app is free when it\u2019s not if you download the app and put your thumb print to authorize what supposed to be a Free download and then they charge you three days later that a big friggin scam.

{"body":"Didn\u2019t realize when I downloaded this that it required a subscription to do practically anything. The free features are too limited (you can only share 5 pages a day) and the premium subscription costs too much, in my opinion, for a single purpose app. I would have paid a reasonable on time fee to unlock some extra features for life, but I am absolutely not going to add another monthly expense to my budget, just for the occasional use. I scanned a 30 page document and then realized there was no way to get it too my computer without signing up for and then canceling a subscription. Even a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d option allowing you to pay a one time fee to share the document for like $.99 a pop or whatever would be better for an occasional user. As it is, the app could be useful for someone who uses it for business, but there is no reasonably-priced option for someone who might use it once every couple months or so. You would have to buy a monthly subscription and then remember to cancel. Their business model probably relies on the idea that people will pay for it and then forget to cancel, which is kind of sleazy, in my opinion. Frankly, I loathe the entire trend away from one-time purchases to subscription models for everything these days, and everyone who engages in it should be shamed.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

It\u2019s a shame no one is willing to help. Great app, but lousy support!!! I do not recommend.

{"body":"Do not use this app! I downloaded it for free because I needed to scan a few things. I then deleted the app from my phone and thought I was done. This morning I got hit with a $40 charge out of the blue. This app relies on the fact that subscription cancelation is a separate process from deleting the app; it\u2019s deceptive, unfair, and disappointing. The app is looking to swindle anybody who doesn\u2019t spend their entire day reading the thousands of pages of user agreements we\u2019re all subject to just for existing in a technologically sophisticated world. So much for good faith and fair dealing! My refund request through Apple was denied, and $40 is a lot of money for a grad student with no income. Bottom line: don\u2019t bother with this app because it preys upon people who assume that the company is acting in good faith.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

The process required me to 1) be home 2) physically insert all the papers into the scanner 3) have patience (which was the hardest part!). This app does everything my scanner did and more, but requires less time and effort. Now, I open the app (at home or on-the-go) and quickly capture page after page. I can save the pages on my phone or email them (as JPEGs or PDFs) to myself and others. The quality of each image is fantastic.

{"body":"I bought this app to scan thousands of family photos and it works very well for this purpose. I built a light box for my iPad Pro so I just put the next photo on a black background and take a pic. It does a very good job at cropping unless an edge of the photo is very dark. Overall I'm happy with the cropping feature. I found sometimes when I switch apps while in the photo shoot mode, I return to a frozen program. I just Kill and restart the app to fix. A minor bug that's easy to work around. However, sometimes after a restart, the last photo I scanned is missing! And sometimes after a scan, photos are just missing. Today I wanted to text a photo I had just scanned only to find out it was never saved! Worse yet, the two previous scans were also missing. This is not acceptable and my reason for 1 star. I don't know how many scans are missing. Beware if you're using this app for large batch scan runs - you may need to check the list after every scan.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"This technology is so important for people today. Writers needed to put their thoughts onto paper without being too tedious. I\u2019m so incredibly grateful that this technology exists. This app is extremely accurate I would say like 98% if you speak clearly and enunciate. The small minor mistakes are easily corrected, and you can go back and see what you meant to say because the mistake is so small. The only request that I would make about this new anywhere app is I wish they had a way to import MP3 files so those can be transcribed. Since we pay $150 a year for this app I think that we should have that feature because that\u2019s the same amount we would be paying for the professional individual in two years time. Plus, not everyone wants to download software on their computer. I use exclusively my iPhone and iPad, so it\u2019s imperative for me to have an app rather than software; I know that many are going this route. I really hope that Nuance gets on board with this and provides this transcribing feature. Being able to import the MP3 files that we could either email ourselves into our iPad, and save it to our Apple files or the iCloud, and then import it into the app through an import button that connects to our iCloud would be amazing. This could be a premium subscription for like $20 a month and I would totally pay it. Other than that everything else is wonderful. There are many ways to export my files; I wish though, that we were able to export them into Scrivener app. So many authors use that app. Overall though, this is the BEST APP THERE IS ON THE MARKET. Nuance seems committed to striving for perfection and future proofing its customers. Please add the transcribing feature to the app.","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}

So I have a a bit of familiarity with speech recognition technology.\n\nOn my iPhone XS, the dictation vastly exceeds Apple\u2019s built-in dictation and I really appreciate the ability to edit dictation by voice. If this quality carried over to my iPad, I would rate the app five stars.\n\nOn my 11 inch iPad Pro, however, this app is basically nonfunctional. It seems like the voice activity detection isn\u2019t working correctly, as it cuts off the beginning and end of speech, while also having accuracy issues in the middle of the utterance. If I hold my iPad perpendicular to my mouth so that I\u2019m speaking into the top of the device, (where two of the microphones are), that seems to help a little bit.\n\nSince Nuance seems to have no reasonable way to contact them for support (their website says they charge users $19.95 to report bugs by phone), I am writing this one star review.

{"body":"I have been pleasantly surprised with how this application works on the iPad Pro (2018). I have been able to plug in a Phillips SpeechMike (LF H3500) using an adapter into the USB port. Pressing the in app icon to activate dictation activates the Phillips microphone. This greatly improves the accuracy and ease of dictation on the iPad. I have been able to program some of the buttons on the microphone to do some simple keyboard shortcuts such as selecting recently dictated text. Unfortunately, there are no keyboard shortcuts built into the app. I would encourage the developers to strongly consider adding keyboard shortcuts, including the ability to toggle the microphone by keyboard, as this would allow for these commands to be mapped to a microphone plugged into the USB port. This would be a huge productivity booster. I have not extensively evaluated the Phillips Speech Mike, but have found it to be reasonably reliable. I programmed keyboard shortcuts using the Phillips application and by setting the microphone into the \"keyboard mode.\" Dictation accuracy has been superb in my limited testing.

Do you get what you pay for with this app? I think so. If your company or business will cover the subscription, don\u2019t think twice and get it.

{"body":"@Fuse Dragon to write this review. As you can see, it was very accurate on the first sentence. The actual sentence was supposed to be, \"I've decided to use Dragon to write this review.\"\nmy favorite part about the application is that there's no sewing function. So, when you need to make a specialized word, there is no way other than typing it in with the keyboard. This seems to be counterproductive since the purpose of the program is to dictate.\n\nThe other thing but it does quite nicely is fail to capitalize at the beginning of certain sentences. You can see this in my prior paragraph. Also it messes up simple words like spelling and sewing, which can be seen in the above sentence.\n\nIn addition to accuracy problems, the program is also very slow.

{"body":"I love the idea of being able to use dictation software on the go, but this is unfortunately completely unusable for that purpose. I attempted to use it to write prose. I used it every day for a full month to give it a chance to do any adjustments needed to provide a better experience and it didn't get perceptible better by the end.\n\nIf the connection is at all shaky, it fails completely. You might say 50 words and get 8 of them picked up (and 3 of those would be incorrect). This is because the transcription is done entirely server side and the application is incapable of handling buffering for more than a couple of seconds. If it tries to send something to the server and the connection is bad, it just fails silently. I would rather have it fallback to an inferior on-device transcription and\/or save the audio + output an in-line graphic indicating that there was a connection issue and that it will automatically retry later + allow me to click it to retry it now. Voice commands, at the least, should be able to be parsed on my device.\n\nIf the connection is amazing - the same times that I would be able to use a full keyboard, generally - it stumbles over all but the simplest phrases, even when I've added them into its word list and pronounced them there. I am from Indianapolis, Indiana, and have about as weak of an accent as you can get - I can only imagine how much worse this would be for someone with a strong accent.\n\nThe auto-off feature is annoying and not customizable. It turns off when I'm waiting for the previous phrase to parse. It turns off when I'm thinking. And there's no wake phrase to turn it back on without physically pressing the decide (like \"Dragon Go\" or something).\n\nThere is no way to distinguish between identically pronounced words in this app, and it doesn't even try to figure it out based on context. It's vs it's, there \/ they're \/ their, John \/ Jon (even if you have Jon added as a word, it will use John).\n\nThere is no way to correct a mis-transcribed word. You can attempt to select it - sometimes you would get a completely different instance of the same or a similarly pronounced word - and then repeat the word or phrase. But then you'll most often just get the same phrase again. And unless you manually leave your document and enter the correct word every time this happens, this will keep happening. Even if you do enter the phrase, sometimes it will keep happening; sometimes it won't. And I have no clue why.\n\nI would expect that, upon importing a document, words and phrases already in the document would be transcribed preferentially over similar-sounding alternatives. They are not; this software does not have this feature.\n\nThere is no way to get the voice recognition recording that was used, so you have to review and perform corrections by hand while the memory of what you tried to type is fresh in your mind. Otherwise you'll find yourself staring at garbage text that bears no resemblance to what you wanted.\n\nVoice commands are inconsistent. Sometimes I would say a navigation phrase and get that phrase verbatim in my text, e.g., \"scratch that.\" Sometimes nothing would happen at all.\n\nIf this were a free perk of the desktop software, and if it included all the voice training performed there, then I'd be willing to give the pair a try. As is, I'm more efficient typing with one thumb.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Excellent dictation, but a fatal flaw. There is no Bluetooth support on iOS. The user manual for the software\/service says that it supports Bluetooth on Android devices. So, if you plan to use this on your iPhone with an AirPod or some other Bluetooth headphone, you can forget it. Perhaps, Dragon should give iOS users 75% off on the $15 subscription until they can sort out how to enable Bluetooth. \n\nOverall, the software is so clunky. It's unfortunate that such amazing dictation is trapped in the body of such a subpar app. They figured out how to do the hard part and couldn't pull off the layup.\n\n--- updated June 26, 2017\n\nAfter two months of trying Dragon Anywhere, I cancelled my Dragon subscription. It ultimately came down to the fact that it is a terrible piece of software that traps and shackles a wonderful power of dictation. The dictation knocks the pants off Siri. \n\nUnfortunately, without smooth ways to input and output content, it becomes a chore to use, and unworthy of a $15\/month subscription. \n\nThe following would begin to address concerns:\n\n1) enable bluetooth input on iOS. Without wireless voice entry, the dream of dictation without tethering is lost. That bluetooth voice entry can be done on Android and not on iOS is inexcusable.\n\n2) Better Dropbox and iCloud integration of dictated text. I won't spell out the details of what is lacking and how it can be fixed. It's sort of obvious, and if the developers can't figure it out on their own, then perhaps it is best that Dragon Anwhere remains in the fringe.\n\n3) $15\/month is darn steep. Dragon could make a lot more money by decreasing the monthly rate, which would increase the number of subscriptions. My guess is that they haven't done a very thorough analysis of their business model and are missing out on visibility and profit.\n\n4) customer support is weird and awful. I navigated through their pages and submitted a question regarding bluetooth to Nuance. After a day or two, I got a reply and was told \n\n\"...we would recommend calling Digital River ( 888-372-1908 option 3). This department handles Dragon Anywhere. They may be able to answer your inquiry about Bluetooth Headset Support.\"\n\nWhen I call Digital River, I learn they handle billing, customer service --- but, their not the technical brains behind the development of the software. \n\nBasically, I get the picture of a technically-stellar company (Nuance) that is awesome at their core expertise (Dictation) and has no clue about business models, user interface, and everything else that could transform their dictation platform into having broad and powerful impact. \n\nToo bad. Apple ought to buy the whole darn thing.... except the history of acquisitions is unkind to the core technology.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

Writing is hard enough to start as it is, I don't need my dictation app turning the mic off after 20 seconds and giving me an excuse to stop. I do not care if it is taking up space in a data center or whatever weak excuse there is for it, just stop doing it. For $15 a month, you can afford it. The mic should stop when I tell it to stop and start when I tell it to start, which brings me to my next gripe. I can't turn the mic on by voice command while I'm driving, I have to press the on-screen mic button... let me stress this, While I'm Driving. There needs to be options to operate Dragon Anywhere completely hands free. Otherwise good app but currently hyper-frustrating.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"For $15.00 a month subsription it should work better than it does. I tape meeting notes for example and then use a bluetooth enabled speaker to amplify the voice on my work phone and then use my own phone as a dictation device. It isn't perfect. If someone says a editing type word or it thinks it heard such a word, then it does weird stuff - like deletes text. It also won't dictate for a full hour. It chokes after about 10 minutes. Also, it's not good to use it if you are driving and unable to look at the red \/ green button -- because it will stop working (fo no good reason) and if you had a great thought - it's GONE! It is good for transcribing hand written notes to speech that you then copy into a document and edit - or if you want to compose an email from notes or minutes from a meeting. I don't type fast -- so it does save me some time. But, I don't recommend buying it if you think that this is your go to app for wrting your novel as you commute - you will not be able to do that.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I purchased\/committed to the trial of Dragon anywhere. While I find it to be effective in dictating there are significant editing limitations. For example, I had dictated all my clinical notes as a trial the software. Somewhere along the way several paragraphs of notes deleted. I found no way to restore the hour of work of writing\/dictating that was lost. In fact, while working to restore the lost paragraphs, I lost the final two paragraphs. As I see, there is no way to restore un-edit or undo typing, via Dragon anywhere. The risk then becomes in the event that you make a notable error there does not present to be any easy or simple way to restore the document or typing it was lost. I will and my subscription today because of this error\/inability, fearing that such could happen again.\n\nI use Dragon for Mac extensively in my clinical practice, finding it to be ineffective way to dictate charts\/clinical notes. I was hoping that Dragon anywhere would provide similar feature, without having to lug around a computer and headset to do my notes. Maybe in the future Nuance will figure this out, but at this point I would not recommend this program.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app was exactly what I was looking for. I am an author and I found that the long hours on the keyboard was killing my hands.

This app has kept me from doing that and so far the last book I wrote was through this app. It is so worth the money and much better speech recognition than the desktop programs I have tried from this company and others.

{"body":"I've been using this product for about six months. It still amazes me with its accuracy and the overall ease of use. I have only given it four stars because I really want them to find a better way to integrated into the rest of the iOS ecosystem. At present, it relies upon you copying text from the dictation notepad into the application you want to use. It does support sending email directly from within the application, but I haven't found that quite as convenient when you are replying to someone's email.\n\nLeaving that aside \u2013 because a big part of that problem is just the rules which Apple enforces for application separation \u2013 I have to say that I find this product quite astounding. It has really changed the way I work. I travel with an iPad mini, and this allows me to work very productively without the need for any external keyboard.\n\nIf you think you would find this product interesting I recommend that you sign up for the trial. See how much you make use of it, and then decide whether it's worth the $15. That is what I did, and I then signed up for a years worth of service.","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"Update December, 2016: I was hoping that the app would and get better and better over the course of time. However, I have found that it has become slower and less accurate. And the worst part of it is that error correction has to be done via dictation. So instead of tapping a location to make a correction, you have to tell dragon to insert the cursor in front of a specific word and then issue your command. That process is very slow. This, along with inconsistent accuracy has led me to cancel my auto renew. It is, sort of OK, but for the price, it's just not worth it. That's especially the case now that Apple has integrated a dictation capability which allows longer documents to be created than the standard snippet voice recognition that people use for texts.\n\nUpdate: 3\/26\/2016. I continue to reap the rewards and competitive edge from this app. Dragon is the best. \nPrevious review: \nThere is no doubt that Dragon Anywhere is the best speech to text voice recognition there is. However, you might think initially that it is only a little better than iOS speech to text. As well, Google's voice typing is actually better than iOS speech to text. In fact, I would go so far as to say that Dragon Anywhere is probably only 5% better than what's already out there. However, when I think back over the past year or so that I have attempted, many times, to fully integrate speech to text as a primary tool for writing emails, reports, etc.\u2026 I have always gone back to typing. Even at 95% efficiency, the current solutions that are available leave too many errors behind and the act of dictating speech as opposed to typing it, makes you more prone to not catching those errors. In my opinion, the 4% improvement of Dragon Anywhere is huge when you consider the reduction in time wasted going back catch errors. In torture testing Dragon Anywhere the past few days, I have found it's accuracy plus the ability to correct errors on the fly using commands, to make it worth shelling out $150 year subscription.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The subscription is a little bit steep, but for long-form dictation (such as outlining and case briefs in law school), it truly is, much better than Siri. With the addition of auto-text, it can be very helpful.

It recognizes ur voice without training.  \n\nThe only cons so far after a day of use is the commands are not easy and some won't work but I can stop and format how I like.  I'm sure once I've been using longer won't be an issue. The other thing when u stop to correct a text it does jump u to the end of the page if u do not turn mic off.  \n\nI have to say as sad as it is, all I need in life is my mobile dragon and my Netflix at the same great price.

{"body":"I have been using Dragon anywhere now for about a month. I am a hospital-based physician. I have a long history of using Dragon products \u2013 for at least 15 years now. I think I have used just about every one of their medical versions. Nuance now has a cloud-based medical product \u2013 unfortunately my organization has not purchased it. I needed something that I could dictate into that was mobile. Although my organization has desktop front-end speech recognition available, that does not always work effectively for me because I had to go into a room that has a PC with the program installed on it.\n\nHere are some positives about this product:\n\u2013 it allows me to dictate using an iPad Pro with keyboard. As you may well know by now, once you put a keyboard on an iPad Pro, the speech recognition icon disappears. You have to otherwise disconnect the keyboard in order to dictate.\n\u2013 Accuracy is about 95%.\n\u2013 Excellent and fast linking with Evernote. This is very effective. However some users have experienced problems because once you send the document off to Evernote, it opens up another page and you have to do a second step \u2013 press \"Sync\". If you don't do that, it won't be sent.\n\u2013 It does a pretty good job of recognizing medical terms even though this is not the medical product. However I have had a few technical names it doesn't recognize. For instance if I dictate \"Zosyn\" \u2013 it was missing that term all the time. So, I had to add that term as a user \"word\". It still didn't recognize the word until I added a unique spoken form. For me that spoken form is \"Zulu Zoh Sin\" \u2013 now it gets it right every time. I use \"Zulu\" as the first word of every auto text I create. It is a unique term and it helps the program recognize right away that I'm about to say an auto text and thus improves recognition dramatically.\n\nKey features that made me willing to pay $15 a month to get this:\n\u2013 Very mobile.\n\u2013 I can dictate on the go. \n\u2013 Ability to use auto text with fields.\n\u2013 Works great with an iPad Pro.\n\u2013 Lets me use my iPhone, if I want to do it that way, while I am reviewing the EHR another PC.\n\nAlthough my organization does have a speech recognition solution, it is not always efficient for me to use it. I have to go to a dedicated PC in order to access it. I think it is a good idea to dictate in front of the patient whenever possible. That way, the patient has a better idea of how much time you're spending on their care, can hear the complexity of their situation and ask questions and besides that, it helps me remember that the patient can always read what I write.\n\nI especially like that I can dictate a note while walking between patients. Sometimes that is a lifesaver. There are times when I will get four admissions all at once. I do not have time to complete a note in a sequential fashion. If I do it that way, other patients will go a long time without any care. This way, I can at least dictate the important parts about the history and physical examination and then I can finish up the note later without forgetting details.\n\nOne caveat: Wi-Fi access is always a requirement. Therefore, if I forget and dictate while I walk into a stairwell \u2013 I will you lose connectivity and may not realize it right away.\n\nI think that this is one of the first versions of Dragon Anywhere. There are a few functions of the program that need to be tweaked a little bit. I'm pretty sure that later versions will add some improvements. Here are a few functions I wish worked a little bit better:\n\u2013 it takes too long to navigate between fields in an auto text document. From the time I say \"next input field\" until it actually performs the function is about a two or three second delay.\n\u2013 It does not allow me to spell words on the fly. Desktop products allow you to do this.\n\u2013 When you add a specific word, it does not allow you to train the word.\n\nTaken as a whole. I really like the product. It helps me be more efficient at work. I pay $15 a month out of my own pocket to have it. Really, I shouldn't have to pay that business expense myself, but nevertheless, the efficiency still makes it worthwhile. Oh, and no worries about PHI. I just title each document with the patient room. That way there is no personal health information.","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}

This results in replaced or deleted text, odd formatting or partial transcriptions being emailed. \n\nNuance customer service did not see these shortcomings as anything noteworthy.

Poor design and no protection for the customers.  A piece of garbage that should have never been released.\n\nUpdate(6\/7\/16). I have used the product for another month and has been trying to extend the subscription by 3 months or 1 year.  The billing department is now based in the U.S. The system would not let me renew my subscription. Even after I called the billing department, and gave them three different valid credit cards (Visa, Paypal, and Amex), and their system still can't make the charge go through. The payment system on Nuance for this product, hosted by Digital River, is pathetic at best. BTW, Digital Rivers blames glitches in the Nuance app for their billing problems. My billing history shows that I have done nothing but trying to give them money, which they won't take.  Not a good start for a launch of an otherwise promising product. Finally, both the Digital River and the Nuance Dragon Anywhere team are more or less indifferent to the inconvenience of the users. There was not a scintilla of apology from any of the reps other than \"we'll look into it.\"\n\nOriginal review:\nAll of the support team is based somewhere in Asia, either India or the Philippines.  While they are polite, they are also useless. There might as well be no customer support. No product support, no customer service, can't resolve billing issues.  Despite the soft voice, the answers are typically a resounding \"no\" or \"sorry we can't help you,\" or \"sorry we can't do that.\" A total waste of time.

I get to the sign on screen and can get no further even though I am using the correct name and password (it was the one Dragon sent to me and works when I contacted them about my problem).  Oh, and when I did contact Dragon for some help, they informed me that since I purchased this from Apple, I need to contact Apple for help!  All around disappointment from someone who has used their products and stayed current since 1996.  The saving grace for me is that I do have Dragon Dictate on my iPad and it does a fair job.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"As a person with paralysis Dragon has been the go-to application for interfacing with full OS computers. This app is not full Dragon; there is no \"spell-mode\", and DA obviously cannot be used to control a phone\/tablet in the  same way that the desktop versions can (that's what Switch Control is for...but I do hope iOS will one day have true, full-on voice controllability). Despite that, this a huge leap forward for mobile OS users who haven't had any reliable tool for dictation until now. From the perspective of a person who really CAN'T type too well, this is an amazing tool. It would be even better if they added spell-mode (I'm not sure if there's anything that would prevent that). \n\nSiri is great for very, very basic iOS control, and yes, the general built in dictational capabilities are very good. However, you absolutely cannot rely on Siri because unlike DA, Siri can't handle silences (long or short), nor can she take dictations that span several minutes or more. It is also crucial that Siri does not have commands allowing a user (like me) to move the cursor, select text, and replace it...all using voice only.\n\nYes, the subscription model is hard to swallow, but I'm willing to accept that as the only realistic way for a profit based company to have the motivation and realistic ROI to develop and maintain a product\/service such as this. I just bought a year of service in hopes that DA will not only be reliable, but that it will also be improved and expanded in the future. For an app that relies on an Internet connection it does make sense that the cost will be more than your average AppStore application. It's not like in-app subscription are unusual nowaday so it's not really something that makes it onto my list of criticisms. I do hope the cost will be justified in the long run, and I also hope Dragon Anywhere will continue to be a rock solid, dependable, true, long form dictation solution on iOS. For some this can be a great tool for replacing the need to repetitively tap the mic icon as they slowly dictate, edit, dictate, and edit text via Siri...for some of us, though, this is a NEED. \n\nHopefully, they will make it much easier to activate the free trial. It would be a shame if that was enough to prevent adoption by more users.","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}

That requires your credit card information etc. just to get the free trial. Of course if your mobile like I am and you're in your car makes it very difficult to get set up on this now. I don't see why they couldn't just give you an automated free trial so you could see how effective it was, before you went through all the hassle of entering all the information that they needed to have that you might not even need if you don't like the trial period really bad sales enablement strategy.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

Almost one out of three times is a mistake. In fairness, I live in a small community and it might be much better and in an urban area. It's interesting to note that many of the dragon commands used to work on iPhone voice dictation, but they've been slowly taken away with updates to the OS. For serious dictation needs, it would be better to get a light weight laptop with Dragon installed. I dictated this note with the standard voice recognition on my iPhone 5S, which is a dragon engine, and works better than the above App. I will try it again in the future as I think Nuance makes great products, this one is just not there yet.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

I used to be tethered to my computer with a USB plug-in headset. But with my newly purchased Nuance Bluetooth Headset, I can dictate while washing dishes and folding laundry. When I am out and about I can dictate on the fly using my iPhone.  And I can  access my documents on both devices. The app has a two-week trial for free. Try it, you'll like it.","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}

Also, as another reviewer noted dragon support is pretty terrible overall.

{"body":"I like the app, which does a good (if no-frills) job of its basic service of allowing decent, editable dictation over iOS.  But all the ancillary services are terrible.  The Nuance website crashed every time I tried to order a year-long subscription.  Then they auto-renewed the monthly subscription after I no longer wanted it, and refused to refund it (although I called immediately after receiving the post-facto auto-renewal notice).  So this is likely the best option for some people, including me, but beware of the terrible customer service and bad payment practices.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

Speak\n\nIt's really that simple. \n\nPersonally, I think the app is great. Syncs well with my Mac, and is incredibly useful for \"brain dumping\" ideas. Also, I really appreciate the attention Nuance has put towards improving the integration of its command reference. \n\nLastly, for those of you bashing the app because of its monthly fee, know this...\n\nIf you can't afford $15 per month YOU'RE the one doing something wrong, not Nuance.","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}

This just seems a lot more expensive for having the on the go version.\n\nSecondly, I should be able to use it when I'm in airplane mode, or when no Internet is available.

{"body":"(These updates are in reverse chronological order if you want to see the history of my review.)\nNow 4 stars. After seeing my review, they contacted me via email and managed to recover my document. I was actually impressed at the time and effort the support person took to fix my issues. I have since learned to use the share feature to save my documents in Dropbox to be safe. I think this app has tremendous potential but does need a few tweaks and definitely a way to autosave to the cloud. And at this stage of the game, I think it is a little overpriced hence the four stars. However, in a reasonably quiet environment and using your microphone on your phone as it does not yet support Bluetooth devices it is surprisingly accurate and useful for a number of things. A good deal of my faith has been restored in Nuance. I look forward to future updates. Thanks Mark!\n--End of 2nd update \u2013 \u2013\n\nUpdate to review, (See below for original review) February 23, 2016-\nJust for fun, I tried called Dragon Support and used the Windows support line. Surprisingly, the man on the line offered to help and put me on hold for a while after I explained the problem. When he came back on he basically told me unless I had saved it in drop box or emailed it to myself there was no way to get it back. Wow! I just can't believe a company the size of Nuance could make a bonehead move like not offering automatic saving and back up is beyond comprehension.\n--End of update \u2013 \u2013\n\nI use the Dragon desktop app which works very well. I thought I'd give this a try as most of the other dictation methods that i've tried on the phone don't do long documents very well.\nI spent a few days, many hours in fact dictating a Book outline. After about 15 hours of total dictation time in the book outline, I was pretty impressed with the app performance. Suddenly, in the middle of a sentence a brand-new document appeared and my old one disappeared. When I said searched their help section, it states that a document deleted from a mobile device cannot be recovered. I'm sorry, I really wanted this app to work, but that is unacceptable. I'm canceling my subscription.","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}

It is difficult to un-subscribe, have to log in, pass words, etc\u2026It is currently not worth the subscription price. Maybe I would use if it was a purchase, or a more reasonable subscription. \n\nSpelling out a word is awkward, dates are awkward, and dictating into the phone is odd, as I don\u2019t  know how stable the app is, so don\u2019t trust it for long dictations.

The dictated text does not come up on the screen until you are done talking making it a essentially  useless. The customer service department of Nuance and Digital River in general is absolutely the worst. They don't listen to your issue at all and simply appear to be reading from a script.\nThe $15 price tag is outrageous.

I ensured my account was activated online and received email receipts of purchase. It still did not work.  I called technical support and was given another number to call.  No one called back.  Nuance does not even have an option for Dragon Anywhere on their phone support line.  So you get routed back and forth and someone takes a message that you will received a call back.  Called twice.

My cards were charged... 3 times and I still had no subscription.\n\nThen i tried to look for support on the website... It looks like they really do not want you asking for support as they hid the contact info in all ways possible...\n\nWell... Long story short... I found a number to call... The message said they were not providing support until later due to \"departmental meetings\" ( is this a little shop? Charging $15 a month?). Called again, the rep blamed another company \"digital river\" for the mistake, transferred me over. Then the the rep at digital river wanted me to produce all sorts of proofs that i was being billed. I said that it was ok, i would just dispute the transactions (she really could not care less)... Then she was already ready to close the call without even asking about the fact that i could not complete the order.. I asked her how could i extend my subscription and place the order (felt already like I was begging) ... And she (acting with indifference) directed me to enter my credit card details again in the same site and process the order AGAIN!!!! And i asked if she was sure that she wanted me to try to do the same it created the problems before, without even checking on the problem. \"Yes\" was the response.\n\nI dictated this review using the native iphone dictation.

{"body":"The dictation is surprisingly good, for a mobile app.  No major complaints there, and it\u2019s a solid 85% accurate, which is right up there with Desktop Dragon.\n\nHowever, the subscription is $15\/month, which is way out of line for a Mobile-only client, particularly one without cross-device sync and easy ties to other apps.  But as is, you\u2019re paying almost as much per year as Dragon for the Desktop, but unlike buying Dragon, you need to keep paying to keep using.  You own nothing, and it\u2019s not $15\/month better than just using the built-in speech rec.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the \u201cfree trial\u201d ends with *no* notification, and just starts billing with auto-renew, which is a bit sketchy.  No IAP or Apple Pay available, so you need to give them your credit card separately on their poorly designed website, which is also not great.\n\nIf they also offered a free Desktop client tapping into the same subscription, maybe.  But practically speaking, the software isn\u2019t as good as they\u2019re charging.  $5\/month and I\u2019d be all over it, but as is, it was worth the 7 days, and I got burned for the first month subscription, but the value just isn\u2019t there.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

And that is even after linking up with my desktop professional version of DragonDictate that syncs my custom vocabulary  and auto text to the mobile dragon anywhere app. Another problem is that it does not format auto text, or input pictures with auto text.

When I saved it to my iPhone files, the pages were all out of order, and instead of adding each new chunk of 10 pages at the end of the document, it added them to the beginning of the document.

Also easy to transfer via ftp server in app, normally turned off of course for security. You can passcode-protect any document. Sometimes it is frustrating if it insists your doc fits in one of the predetermined sizes\/shapes, which makes your doc look distorted but the original is still there if needed, and you can still try another. For example I want to trim off the bottom half of a page but then say it is \u201cLetter\u201d but it stretches what\u2019s left. Saying \u201cOriginal Size\u201d solves shape but makes the email recipient unable to print without expertise.

If you do business related anything often then this is app worth investing it. It\u2019s simple and straight forward. It\u2019s as user friendly as anything out to date. For example, get the document you need, hold phone over said document and boom, it\u2019s scanned. You don\u2019t event have to press anything..it automatically does it for you.

{"body":"This product is nowhere near as good as the company they bought ours product. I have used this app since they bought Hunite on the 10 month trial and have been disappointed continuously.\n1- The app constantly crashes or will not download my current schedule.\n2- I am unable to see the flight crew that I am working with.\n3- There is a subscription fee to use the app, even though it seems like an app that hasn't even been beta tested yet.\n4- The export feature to LogTen Pro never functions properly. It constantly exports flights incorrectly. It will make duplicate flights. Also, if you have been reassigned flying it will export the reassigned flights and the original even though you didn't work the original.\n\nI had none of these issues with Hunite and I did not have to pay a subscription for it. After being an apple product user since the mid-2000s this is my first app review ever. I will never pay for this apps subscription unless they fix all of these issues.\n\nIf you are looking for an app that functions better and provides similar functions try out FC View on the App Store.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

It would be nice to also have block hours and credit hours for each trip provided. There is also no way to add crew notes like other apps offer. \n\nMy advice is to choose another app such as FC View.

In Hunite they were.  That was actually my FAVE thing in Hunite.  If I have to mess around opening and closing screens, I'll just use a screenshot of my skedj.\n4.  Map is cool, (just like Hunite). I like the mileage stats and \"# of airports\" features; cool and fun but not really worth $12. \nI get 10 months free as a displaced Hunite user but I will DEF not pay when the time comes unless I can see my coworkers and the phone numbers are active.

Just because you note something somewhere does not make it ok to charge people so much for something. I used this app a handful of times back in August and have now paid you $100. And I get that you\u2019re saying it\u2019s all legal, between the App Store auto subscription and you providing the information that it is a free trial that will change to a subscription. But how can you possibly justify charging $208\/year on a weekly subscription? Shane on you. You may not be legally at risk on this, but you should be ashamed. You can\u2019t control how the App Store works, but you control your prices. You should me ashamed of extorting so many people and trying to justify with that scripted legal response. It was a well functioning app, but maybe fix the major billing complaints instead of just giving us one of these \u2014> \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"This is app is similar to a handful of other scanner to JPEG and PDF formats that have emerged quite recently in app stores, and have taken smartphone capabilities to the next level for users. The app itself is fully functioning. However, that is where things stop for iScanner. Therefore, in my opinion this makes the app underserving of the hoped for 5 star rating.\nI personally have used other apps of the same scanning purposes to elevate my iPhone experience and have a way to save important documents such as paper tax invoices to my phone - thus, not losing anything of importance like I otherwise might with a solely physical copy. What made me generously rate this app only 4 instead of the possible 5 out of 5 stars is the fact that in order to utilize what other scanning apps other than iScanner offer, I don\u2019t have to pay the membership fee that the app unsurprisingly offers from the very moment you open it to use. The reason that the iScanner app is one of the top listed \u201cscanner\u201d app searches in the iPhone App Store (above the competition scan apps that can actually offer more than what iScanner alone, without the membership subscription does, is because it is a \u201cpurchase friendly\u201d -if no other words- app and therefore a money-maker in whatever regards. The advertising is guaranteed to be much better for this fact. But, as myself and probably many others can tell, it is not the greatest scanning up available on the App Store like it\u2019s \u201ctop\u201d featuring night insinuate... So, in regards to app development by the creators here, it\u2019s an unimpressive product.\nHopefully, this message is made clear to those responsible for making sure their app is of as high in quality as possible.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

The amount of time it would take to manually reorder them would\u2019ve been ridiculous.\nI deleted and attempted to rescan a few pages only for the app to again reorder all the pages.\nThere is also no readily available customer service contact for me to voice my concerns.\nIf this bug is fixed I would happily give this app 5 stars and it would be well worth the $1 a month I spent.

Matter of fact, I\u2019m not sure I ever have mistakenly subscribed to a service I didn\u2019t want.

I never check my personal email, and randomly I went in and saw a purchase for $8.XX. I started looking into it further - I have been billed weekly since I downloaded the app on Sept 5th for $3.99 per week until today, when I finally cancelled it on Jan 24th. Near $80 in total that I didn\u2019t knowingly authorize. Very, very sneaky. Shame on me for not checking my bank account or emails. But, shame on these developers for the \u201csneaky\u201d button placement and ease of access to a subscription based model of income.\n\nBuyer beware - this service is nowhere near worth $3.99 per week, even if you are aware of it or not.

However, after the update, it\u2019s harder to scan documents, even with the \u201cauto mode\u201d it didn\u2019t let me adjust the border as it did with the previous mode. \n\nThe manual is efficient at best, producing terrible quality when I scan.

I sometimes have to tap on it 5 or 6 times before it\u2019ll actually open and stay open. It\u2019s kind of annoying. Scratch that, it\u2019s really annoying. Developers, please fix this bug!!

The ability to pin any address while driving (or even at home) and export all homeowner data to Excel does more than just save you time and money. The functionality is incredible and is so user friendly. Since downloading this I\u2019m pumping out twice as many mail campaigns with ease, my leads are better quality and volume has picked up.

No more getting calls from owners that don\u2019t fit what I\u2019m looking for.

{"body":"Gone are the days of laboriously looking up property records yourself!  With this app, you only have to drop the \"pin\" on the location, save it, and it does the rest in looking up both property address and owner address. I've found it to be very accurate on the addresses, since I still spot-check...  And you can do as many as you want for $19.99\/month, so it's also a bargain.\n\nI've been using it for a while, and the company has also made several enhancements since it debuted:  you can now get last sale date, and phone number of owner.  They're going to start supplying email addresses soon - a huge help in at least having somewhere to start in getting in touch w sellers.  \n\nIf you are a real estate investor who does D4D to send direct mail, or call potential sellers, I would highly recommend you using this app.  Head over to its Facebook page to get tutorials on how to use most effectively too.  Once you get the hang of it (which doesn't take long at all), you will love it!","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}

I can easily tag 200 properties in a couple hours, save the list, and by the time I drive back to my office the spreadsheet is ready to download and immediately print mailers vs. spending hours looking up data and typing into a spreadsheet. If you or your team does driving for dollars, I would highly recommend this time saving tool.","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is the best app out there when it comes to Driving for Dollars. It\u2019s saved me countless hours and has incredible value considering the low cost.

{"body":"This app will simplify your driving for dollars significantly. Being able to just drop pins, save the list, and get the information you need to contact homeowners is incredible. No need to sit in front of a computer for hours trying to drag the info out of 10 different websites. But...you have to actually click \u201csave\u201d when you\u2019re done with your trip as another disgruntled user posted, or you will lose your pins. This is no different than any other iOS app, in my opinion. Drop your pins, click save, get your list. It\u2019s that easy.  Totally worth the money.","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}

Completely dissatisfied with this app that\u2019s supposed to make life easier and remove a lot of the grunt work. I\u2019ll be requesting a full refund and trying out some other alternatives. I will not get back the two and a half hours spent looking for these deals. Instead I\u2019ll need to go back to those same neighborhoods a second time looking like a creeper, for the sake of damage control.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"This is a good app for driving for dollars but it needs work. I am writing this while currently EXTREMELY annoyed with the app but first off, you cannot combine lists which means if you are working a big neighborhood and want to drive for an hour or two at a time, you have to make separate lists which is just annoying. Secondly, to try and work around that first problem, I did the first half of a neighborhood this morning, and with the intentions of completing the second half of the neighborhood this afternoon, I left the app open so that I can have it all under one list. Well, I clicked back onto the app just now and I lost all 40 houses that I had pinned even tho I did not X out of the app. So I lost 2 hours of work this morning and have to start over. And the last one is a suggestion that would make the app more useful which is to have a feature that tracks the streets that you drive as you drive them. It would eliminate the need for users to print out a map and have to highlight streets as you drive them.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Crashes wayyyy too much and the style options are limited. I would have liked a matching heading on my resume and cover letter, app doesn't allow. I had to create the documents with this app then edit them with another.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app requires you to pay them. Don't use it unless you are prepared to do so. I spent a good amount of time only to find out they require payment.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Let me build a resume easily but never was able to get it out of the app. Something wrong with the email of the app.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"It keeps trying to make me pay for the extension for the full version each time I use it between devices.  I paid for the extension one time, and since it won't allow me to use the full function anymore.  Overall user friendly and simply designed.  Will not let me print from the app though, and will only share out via email sourcing.","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Great for fine tuning your resume whenever there's some extra time. Format is easy to navigate and allows you to quickly add notes to whichever section you want, experience, cover letter, etc all have a separate folder tab that you can name.\nBest feature in my opinion is: you work on separate parts individually (basic text and paragraphs) but when you go into previewing, the program lays it out and adjusts to the style you're in and can switch them to find a style that will look best for your application","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Overall this is an easy way to create nice looking CVs, with an ability to copy into new versions and modify with ease.  You can pick from a number of formats, and switch between them.  A pleasure to use, much easier than tinkering around with Word or Pages docs.","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I sent feedback via the Resume app on April 19, 2017.  I noticed formatting issues when I didn't input a description for past experience.  I was attempting to reduce the length or number of pages.  For my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 since some recruiters.  Think a long r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is TMTR too much too read.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Computer broke, needed resume app asap. Not only does this build it for you, it sends it to whoever you need AND ITS FREE!!!! The other apps I spent time building a resume with asked for money when time to save. This one didn't. I don't leave reviews but figured I would because this made my day.","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I'm sure many of you are experiencing the same frustration I did when trying to save your resume after all that hard work. If using this app on an iPad you must activate your iOS email in order to export the PDF (only version) and send it as an email. If you want to print it just email to yourself.

{"body":"Spent 20 minutes building a solid resume, when I was done I wanted to save it so I could send it to potential employers, but you can't!

{"body":"I downloaded the app and created my resume and it was perfect. I could not send it so I purchased the app for $2.99 which would be fine IF it worked!

I broke down and pay the $3.99 for the Go Pro. I was still unable to export my resume. Eventually I gave up, and downloaded the app on my iPHONE. I rebuilt my entire resume, and exported it with zero problems. This app is awesome, but do not attempt to use this app on an iPad. It is a waste of time.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app was such a big help for me. I don't have a computer or a laptop, so to be able to put together a professional resume in minutes is so awesome. Even though it's free, you still have to make purchases to be able to send or save your resume, and even to have more resume styles available. It is worth it, I did not spend a lot of time preparing and I now have a resume that I can be proud of. Thanks.","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}

Well, that didn't happen & Apple can't seem to explain how this happened but they were quick to offer a refund & ban my credit card from Apple\/Itunes.

No word of a lie, I spent just shy of $12 on resume building apps. Overall I purchased three duds and two functioning ones, this being one of them. Despite it being a bit of a hassle and having a relatively boring interface, I cannot sit here and say I am dissatisfied. I got my resumes all  taken care of! And yes, there is a fee of $1.99 to unlock the templates plus another $1 if you choose to have your ads removed. Overall that is a small price to pay all things considered. Four stars from me!","category":"Business","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"The app itself is pretty easy to use. The only real complaint I have about the app is that A. You can't save\/send the finished resume to your phone WITHOUT purchasing an upgraded version of the app and B. It has 2 different upgrades which I think should just be 1, there's one to remove the ads ($1.99) and one to add more styles ($1.99) and I chose the \"More Styles\" option and still have all the ones from before. So I would've given it a 5 if it weren't for those annoying traits.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I HATE this app. I spent hours working on my resume to find it doesn't have a save\/send button that actually works. I paid the two bucks thinking that would solve the problem...nope.

Otherwise, it will all smush together. \n\nWhen you edit a portion of content, you must click on a different portion of content before exiting that section, or else your changes will not be saved. \n\nAlso it will not let you cut and paste the finished product for editing in other applications.

Too many buttons, too much going on at one time.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"As a freelance graphic designer who doesn\u2019t like to be tied down to laptops and expensive design computer program contracts, I live and work on this app. It\u2019s like Adobe InDesign but you don\u2019t need a college course to figure out how to use it. It\u2019s very intuitive. There\u2019s always room to improve and an app as dynamic as this is bound to have a little bug here and there, but it\u2019s never anything I can\u2019t work around. And even still, nothing comes close to this app. Not even Canva. If you\u2019re choosing between those two, Desygner is the one you want, whether you\u2019re a pro or a newbie and whether you intend to pay for premium or not. Enjoy! :-)","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I have no complaints..but I do have a suggestion. Maybe add on a gif animate option.. like on the photobucket app. That would kick this up a notch.","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This has a lot of features that you normally can't get with a free app, so that good, but I found it kind of hard to work with. I think the font choosing system especially needs change. Maybe putting the fonts into categories like \"thin\" or \"fancy\" or \"bold\" would make it a lot quicker and easier to find what's needed. Also, the tool bar covers the bottom of of the picture, which makes putting text on the bottom basically impossible. Kind of annoying. Other than that, it's a great app!","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

Sometimes because of using it on the phone I have to do things like 2 or 3 times, but once you get the hang of it you\u2019ll be good to go.

{"body":"I'm searching for an affordable Photoshop alternative and gave this app a try. I signed up on their site and found it was very easy to create a header. The problems started after that. \nFirst, I couldn't delete any projects on the site; it must be done in the app. \nSecond, The desktop site is prone to freezing and keeping deleted images or projects. \nThirdly, I tried altering the header that I created but the program blew up the image and there was no option to resize it.\n\nThe only good feature I can say about the app is that I was free to delete my profile.

{"body":"I run a software development team and I can recognize poor QA when I see it.  I can always tell a deployment happened in FreshBooks recently, because things start going wrong.  This week, I had the secondary contacts list suddenly disappear.  This affected our ability to send out an invoice on time, which for a small business is a crippling problem.  Then I encountered the next bug. I needed to re-login.  This is no big deal as this is how I always know they\u2019ve changed something.  When I tried to enter my credentials, it took me to a dialog forcing me to create a new account.  There was no ability to go back to a screen to log in.  Even clearing the app out of memory took me right past the log in screen to the create new account dialog.  The only fix was to uninstall the app and reinstall.  That\u2019s such an amateur oversight that one would not expect from an established application.  This only comes up when there is no real application testing to verify that it\u2019s actually usable versus the devs just meeting requirements.  This bug doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal except that when I\u2019m trying to start the clock on-site at the client\u2019s location, I can\u2019t be seen playing on my phone.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

I have explained that I didn\u2019t use it, did not need it, and repeatedly asked them to stop calling. They call ALL THROUGHOUT THE DAY. It\u2019s becoming harassing at this point. This has to stop.

About one out of three times, the timer appears to pause, but if I close and re-open the app, it\u2019s still timing. I just use the stopwatch on my phone to record my time now, because FreshBooks can\u2019t be trusted, and billing my clients accurately is very important.

Unfortunately, this is a NO GO. Apparently this was added to the new Freshbooks app and was not previously on the Freshbooks Classic app.\n\nTo me, this takes away from having a professional image with your clients. Typically, this kind of branding only accompanies FREE apps and alerts the client that you are using a FREE app and implies that you are not fully invested in your business.  \n\nI also think that it is inappropriate for a client to be provided the Freshbooks\u2019 direct email link when you are emailing the client about a confidential financial transaction between your company and theirs. A natural response to receiving it would be to click the hyperlink, not realizing that it will not be going to you but to Freshbooks. I believe the client will question this.\n\nThis creates too much confusion! The objective is to keep it simple, quick, professional and convenient, for clients.  \n\nAs for a positive, I do like that Freshbooks has real people, kind people, that answers their phones and that you can physically contact them. Big kudos for that! Unfortunately, the young lady  I spoke with says that they cannot remove the Freshbooks branding and email from the invoices at this time.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I hate to write this. I really do. My company has used and loved Freshbooks since 2010, and we\u2019ve recommended it dozens of times. \n\nThe new iOS app, for our account, is basically unusable. When you login, it begins a \u201cSyncing Account...\u201d, and then we have to wait sometimes more than 2 or 3 minutes for it to be useable. The interface simply freezes. When you click on something, nothing happens for maybe 30 seconds, and then it responds to your click, but then freezes again for another 30 seconds. This goes on for a couple minutes. If the point of an iOS app is to access data quickly, this app fails 100%. \n\n(BTW, we\u2019ve been in touch with their support, which is amazing, and they are looking into this issue for us)\n\nAll that said, since this latest update (today), once the freezing stops, then the app is useable and quite nice. \n\nI really want to love the new Freshbooks as a whole, but they\u2019ve removed SO many features of Classic, and some were removed without any obvious practical reason (just adding a check box would bring back the functionality), it\u2019s difficult to understand the reasoning. Our expectation with the new Freshbooks was that it would be an upgrade, a better product. Instead, it feels like a beta product or really, an alpha. It\u2019s just inferior to Classic in so many ways. It IS better in a few ways (faster navigation, faster yet not as smart search, cleaner and more modern interface), but so many things were sacrificed, we are (gasp) considering switching to Quickbooks or Harvest or one of the many competitors who are only in this space because of the trailblazing of Freshbooks. \n\nWe love love love this company. We're just not understanding their choices at this point, and as a small business, we can\u2019t wait much longer without sacrificing our efficiency. We may go back to Classic, even though we are now used to the New Freshbooks (and it\u2019s SO much better looking, etc).","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

They no longer support PayPal, authorize.net and a host of other gateways and are reduced to Stripe (which has processing issues with certain cards) and WePay (which has a limited interface).  They\u2019ve also made migrating difficult on a number of fronts - having to reset the way invoices are paid by editing a single invoice, which is not documented and unintuitive, and not giving the option to choose a different payment gateway when migrating, if your current payment gateway is not supported.  Additionally, the new online interface is very unintuitive - they\u2019ve opted to fill up the client page with a long transaction history and neglected to make finding the invoices easy. \n\n I used to be a big fan of FreshBooks, but I\u2019m looking for alternatives now, because of the direction they seem to be taking.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"This is a simple, clear cut app. Easy to use, easy to invoice. \nI don\u2019t like the UI nearly as much as the old version, and I wish I had a home page that I could easily access to see everything summed up like in the old app. \nThis move makes one migrate to the desktop more than the old version, which is annoying.\nThey have also taken away features in the invoices themselves, like no longer offering a dedicated space for PO numbers, which is important to a lot of contractors. I know I can use the \u201cnotes\u201d section, but having a space up top with the PO was much nicer, and why take it away? \nJust too dumbed down.  \nI still like freshbooks in general, but this app reminds me of the freshbooks app from two or three versions ago. They made great strides over the years, now they\u2019re winding back to a version with less features.","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I was introduced to Freshbooks through an entrepreneurial class that I took at a local college, It was highly recommended.  After a 30 day free trial, it became abundantly clear that Freshbooks was a seamless fit for my small start-up floral business.  I am still learning how to navigate and tweak it  with the help of a  wonderful and eager support staff just a click away.  The tiered pricing options are very attractive whether you are a start up or well seasoned.  I could not be more pleased with this product !  Thank you : )","category":"Business","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Freshbooks has issues syncing quite often.  It won't remove a discount I keep trying to remove. It shows the correct amount, I send it, then it syncs and re-applies the discount.  Now, I look like an idiot sending a client a heavily discounted invoice three times, followed by a text message that it's a bug, not a gift.\n\nAfter saving or sending an invoice, the UI is unresponsive for several seconds.  Have lots of invoices to send or expenses to record?  You'll have to sit and wait a few seconds each time.  It's not much, but when you're trying to record an expense as you leave a meeting, you want to snap a photo, record it quickly, save it, and go. It's bothersome.\n\nItems for invoices are all out of order and sometimes disappear.  It's frustrating that something I know I've used before has to be looked up to be used again.  Some clients have odd numbered dollar amounts for some services. Hold on, let me search for that email from last year to find it... But wait, isn't that why I'm using Freshbooks?!\n\nYou can't apply flat discounts or negative $ amount items; only percentage-based discounts.  You can do it online or in the other app, IIRC, but not here?  Nonsense. Leave this crap and go back to the old app.\n\nIt's functional, but buggy, and frustrating when it doesn't do what you tell it to do. The UX is ok, but just flat doesn't work sometimes.  I avoid using it out of frustration, which makes the entire service pointless to have, as now my financial records are behind.\n\niPhone 6S, iOS 9.3.3","category":"Business","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"The developers of Tides Pro, Elecont LLC, have had over 3 months, as all developers received beta access June 4th, to update their app in time for the public release of IOS 12 and WatchOS 5.  Upon the initial payment for the purchase of Tides Pro, it was never presented as a purchase for only a specified timeframe and had that been the case, Elecont LLC would\u2019ve been fine in failing to continue updating this app.  I have over 100 apps on my iPhone, 90% of which I didn\u2019t pay for, and they have all been updated prior to the public release of IOS 12 and WatchOS 5, as that\u2019s the expected norm.  In failing to find time to update Tides Pro in the period since June 4th, Elecont LLC needs to refund those of us who purchased this app in good faith that they would uphold their end of the purchase agreement by keeping it functional with the Apple Watch.  That is the right thing to do by any ethical standard and Elecont LLC should additionally remove the statements and pictures indicating Tides Pro has current functionality with the Apple Watch.  I will be flagging it and alerting Apple as to the current false advertising and expect a refund ASAP.  I\u2019ll finish by noting that since Tides Pro\u2019s inception in 2015, per version release notes on the App Store, they have made a total of 2 new releases in the life of the app.  It should be noted that most apps eclipse this number of versions in a month.  Hopefully, Elecont LLC will update the app and repair the functionality issues with the Apple Watch.  I hope they find embarrassment in the fact that of all my Apple Watch Apps, they are the sole app that is listed as incompatible and that this glaring failure is enough to incite action to update.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

It\u2019s intuitive, easy and fun. I look forward to the quotes, as well as the verbal weather descriptions. Why only a four? The symbols are a bit difficult to differentiate. Maybe too many and very similar. I would highly recommend this app!!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"I love this app! It's accurate, it's funny, it keeps me entertained for much longer than I should be playing with it (why do I need to know the weather in Kuala Lumpur when I can't locate it on a globe? Because it doesn't get humid enough in California to warrant some prolifically profanity laden forecasts and I feel like I'm being deprived of some AMAZING weather descriptions so I travel the world through the app to see what I'm missing). My only complaint (more of a whinge really) is that my favourite weather voice, Martha from the UK, seems to have lost her job. Moira, Tessa and Karen are alright, but please reinstate Martha!\n\nUpdate: Thank you, thank you, thank you! So happy she's back in business!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I love this app. It has a good sense of humor, the information on the screen is logically and easy to read. It doesn\u2019t get bogged down by unnecessary ads or unrelated content.\n\nIt would earn a 5 star if they added the percentage chance of rain into both the daily and hourly forecast.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I like this weather app with all the options. I use it over the stock weather app on iOS. It seems to be accurate much of the time. I love how colorful it is and the animations it has. \nHowever, 10% of the time it shows a location error and I have to refresh it multiple times before it's back to normal. And with the animations, right now it's winter where I live and -12 below and it's showing a summer animation with green fields\/ sometimes fall. Sometimes it shows winter landscapes, but 50% of the time it's not showing the correct animation. Developers please fix. This app could be great. Just needs some work to make it consistent. Then would be 5 stars.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

Sigh...","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}

I live in Ohio and the weather here is really unpredictable. We can experience several seasons in a week's time, so you definitely need a little humor to get you by! I honestly wish more background pictures were available other than the current background or just boring color. I however love the app and recommend it if you need to know the weather with some humor!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

My best friend and I live many thousand of miles apart, but we are both Great Lakes weather geeks - we will screen shot the best phrases and send them to each other a couple times a week.

It\u2019s probably a very easy fix but right now, it\u2019s difficult to read.\n\nI keep it set to \u201csome\u201d profanity and it\u2019s just right for those who perk over my shoulder while I check the current and extended weather.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"I absolutely love this app. It takes some real genius and talent to create a useful application. To make an app entertaining takes creativity a unique perspective on life. This application is both very useful and uniquely entertaining. I expect a weather application to be informative but funny as well? What a great idea! The developers have really delivered in both aspects. Every time I open the app, I get very accurate and up-to-date information on the weather which is very important to me. Secondly, I get a daily dose of humor that is refreshingly edgy. I'd gladly pay for the app, but I'm very appreciative of the fact that it's free.

I have one suggestion though, if you ever get around to adding more accents, how about adding more US accents with names that describe what their accent will sound like? For example: Boudreaux for a Cajun accent, Billy Bob for Southernish Male,  a Boston accent, a mobster accent, etc. Don\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible and if not, it\u2019s already plenty of fun!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

It's perfect.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"It's a nice-looking interface, provides decent information, and provides funny quotes. (Turn off the adult mode if kids can access your app.)\n\nThis gives you what you need to know, and isn't overwhelming. If you're looking for animated, time-based weather radar, or want to view weather for multiple cities, look elsewhere.\n\nThree areas of recommended improvement:\nFirst, the ad space at the bottom tries to load wrong-sized ad units. The ad area should also be bordered and marked as ad space.\n\n(Yes, this problem goes away if you're nice and pay the developer for his hard work by turning off ads. Which you should do.)\n\nSecond, the main screen needs an indicator to scroll down for more information.\n\nLastly, the settings screen could use a bit of work. The new symbol key and weather definitions are buried at the bottom. Those would be great to integrate into the main screen as modals when clicking on a term or icon.\n\nI also recommend adding \"thundersnow\" as a symbol, and, as a stretch feature, an alert if Jim Cantore is sighted in your zip code (\"Get out of town now\" mode).","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}

There are only 2 things that could make it better... a widget and an apple watch app. So I can see the phrases on my wrist \ud83d\ude02\nI especially love how sometimes it says it\u2019s 400 degrees out when it glitches.

{"body":"Was wanting more humor directly related to current weather. But in any case the current temp is 20 degrees hotter than app says it is.

Right now where I live is in the drought cycle, beige being the predominate color in the landscape. But, I keep being told by this app that it is raining. Usually it\u2019s a light rain but often it claims to be more than that. While I would love to have all of this supposed rain the weather is more accurately described as you will be branded by your seatbelt buckle!

{"body":"Been using the app for a 2-3 of months. A big improvement in the latest releases was to fix the upper case issue in discussion text, but readability is still a problem. The font is too small and white on black background is terrible for the eyes. Otherwise there is a lot to like. The fact that there is good discussion is a huge advantage over the other, shallow weather apps out there. The map features are ok although I wish it would display more than one overlay at a time. Switching between clouds and precipitation and wind speed is a pain. I\u2019d like to see all. The forecast graphics are hokey and not all that useful, especially \u201cprecipitation.\u201d Little beakers that slowly fill to display a likelihood percentage of snow\/rain per day? Grade-school level. I think the developers are on the right track, though, and this app is the best since STORM, which I\u2019m still broken-hearted about. I use the NOAA enhanced radar app along with 1weather to get everything I need, especially lightning strikes.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Beautiful app but still waiting on a more detailed hourly and daily forecast. I've been a premium subscriber for a few years but I'm not using this app because I'd like more details in my forecast. I only use 1Weather during hurricanes because I like the radar.

{"body":"This app looks and functions great, providing more information than most apps in a relatively easy to use (though it\u2019s confusing at first) UI. The issue I have with 1Weather is the highly questionable accuracy of the extended forecasts\u2014compared to other apps and websites, there\u2019s typically a 20-30\u00b0 difference in temperatures a week from the present. So, for extended forecasts, I\u2019m more apt to look at my built-in iPhone weather app, who sources their numbers from weather(.)com. I\u2019m not sure where Weather1\u2019s information comes from (but I also didn\u2019t do much to find it).","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

Definitely the best weather app out there.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The live radar is indispensable for storm info.  BUT, please give us a way to opt out of flood plain warnings.

It\u2019s compatible with IOS 12 too.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"1Weather might just be the best all around weather app that I\u2019ve tried. From my user experience 1Weather is quite accurate with both short term and extended forecasts.

So when I'm about to go outside and need to see what the weather is going to be for the day, I'm stuck looking at the weather from 1 or 2 days ago with no way to see updated info except uninstalling and reinstalling the app! Bummer.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I\u2019ve been using 1Weather for a few years, and it used to be a great app but I can\u2019t use it any more. 1) The Android version is miles ahead of the iOS version, which has an ugly UI. 2) The UI isn\u2019t optimized for iPhone X. 3) I have to force quit the app constantly because it doesn\u2019t refresh when I go back into it. 4) When changing to another city in the 10-day forecast view, only the first 5 days display for the next city - have to force quit to fix that.  5) When I go to Settings> Contact Support, I just get a message stating it can\u2019t open email.  For these reasons, I\u2019m out.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app is better than most weather apps as far as predicting the chance of precipitation and 3-day forecast. \nRadar and forecast are easy to access. \nThe extended forecast is laughable.

The high for this week, the first week of July in Ohio, is 0\u00b0 according to the app. Obviously, somebody is not doing his or her job.\nIf you don\u2019t care about a 12 week forecast, this app is really good.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"This is the most accurate, smooth weather app out there. I would definitely recommend it more than the one preloaded on iPhone. If I could give more than 5 stars I would!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app has a nice layout and shows pressure (which I watch as a migraine trigger) as well as temperature.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Carried this on my Samsung and when I made the Apple 7 transition I had to get it back. Best radar of any app, great layout overall. Must have.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is excellent. It is accurate , detailed weather and beautiful. It tells you everything you need to know about the weather. The free version has non intrusive ads. The paid version is $1.99 . It will remove the ads , but the ads are not bad at all like a lot of weather apps. I had this app on Android too. As soon as I got my iPhone 7, I installed this. I highly recommend this app. It's the best weather app of all","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I wanted this to work.\n1Weather was forecasting thunderstorms starting at 7 am throughout the day at 6:30 am. No other App was - not STORM nor even Apple's built-in weather App. \n20 minutes later they completely flip flop and are not calling for rain until later this afternoon. This flip-flop is not why I have a weather App. I have found an hour by hour forecast option in STORM and it will be my go to Weather App.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

If I swipe across, I have to leave it there for an unreadable amount of time until it updates. Please fix.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app was my goto app and for the last two months, it has become the most unreliable app. When it's sunny outside it says raining. The entire week predictions are all over the place and don't match with any actual weather report.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I've had this app for years. I've been on Android platform for the longest time and experienced many buggy apps, but this one was always solid. Now that I've made the switch to an iPhone I'm so grateful that this app is available here too. It's clean, beautiful, and accurate. I use several weather apps for different functions. One that is a very fast loading radar, but isn't nearly as nice as this one if I'm in an area with poor data speeds, another that shows lightning in my area, but this is still my go to app. I don't give reviews often, however the devs deserve a good review for building and maintaining such a quality app. Thanks devs you're on point!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Had a thunderstorm last night, received 40 alerts throughout the course of the night.  If you allow the app to send you severe alerts, expect to get identical alerts, three or four at a time, all through a storm.

{"body":"Great app love the videos to learn more about the form and types of clouds and the ads are barely noticeable.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"1Weather is accurate, visually appealing, and provides extremely detailed forecasts. I couldn't ask for anything more in a forecast that this app has. Just amazing!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I love it! I also like that you can get the extended forecast. Seems pretty accurate so far! Love how visual the app is too!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This weather app does the job and does it well. I've used for several weeks and have had no issues. User friendly!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The single reason in bought this app is because it has the Lezak Recurring Cycle in its long range predictions. I am an amateur storm chaser and a major weather enthusiast and IMHO, the LRC is the most accurate long range prediction model there is. It generally nails the presence of weather systems using a proprietary cyclic forecast model that changes from year to year.  Once it is locked in, generally in late November, it is pretty darn accurate. It might not hit the highs and lows spot on,  but it predicts the dynamic makeup of the atmosphere helping us know what type of weather to expect. Don't waste your time with the accuweather 90 day, this is the real deal. Glad it is finally on an app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I've been using 1Weather for a long time; first on my LG 4 then on my Samsung tab.

Is there anyway to get rid of the ads?","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I've paid for Dark Sky, used Weather Channel and other apps, but this is by far the best!\n\nIt does exactly what it's suppose to do, has a beautiful UI, and I can't remember it ever crashing. Everything you want from an app.\n\nAs a fellow developer, I commend you on your effort! Well done!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I had The Weather Channel App for a long time before this. As a budding meteorologist, I wanted something that would give me all of the variables I needed. A friend of mine had this and I instantly deleted The Weather Channel app and downloaded this. It has everything you need to know: hourly temps, daily temps, winds, wind chill, and it even goes way further out than any other app (to give you at least an idea of what it will be like). I anticipate keeping this app for a very long time. \nOh, and the ads aren't overwhelming like they are on just about every other weather app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was a good app... 'til I updated my 6s Plus to iOS 10 and now the widget constantly freezes\/doesn't update. Guess I'll stick with the stock weather app since it seems accurate and updates instantly! Plus I noticed Apple no longer uses Accuweather. They now use The Weather Channel.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"When I got my iPhone I was so disappointed at the time that One Weather was not available simply because of its layout and features. I still use it on my old Droid and my Kindle Fire and I absolutely love it. I periodically searched for One Weather on Apple and finally saw it this morning. It is significantly different than the other versions I use, but I'll take it!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"If it's the best then why only four stars? Because it has the opportunity to be even better!\n\nI was a huge 1Weather fan over on Sndroid so I was excited to see it finally make the journey over to the dark side of iOS.\n\nSaying that, I do have two huge complaints...both about the radar:\n\n1) loading the radar images take forever. Screen dims before it finally loads so that is 30+ seconds. \n\n2) the radar doesn't update in the background or when coming back to the app. If I checked at 7am but come back at 3pm, it still shows the 7am radar loop. I have to fully close the app and reopen...only to deal with annoyance #1 again. \n\nFix those two things and the app will be near perfect. Would up my rating to five stars too.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Love how easy this app is to use!  It is accurate and gives all the weather info you need...I check it every day.  The longer range forecast is nice, too!  Highly recommend!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

For those of us who do documented record keeping this would be a great help when required present evidence.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I want to support this app but the only way to do so is to spend a fortune. The subscription of basically useless info should be around $6.99 at most. No one cant predict accurately after 2-3 days anyway. Drop the price and you\u2019ll get way more subscribers.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Not a cloud in the sky here and it says 79% cloud cover. Another time it was completely cloudy and it said 15% cloud cover.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"There are plenty of apps that in no way should need people to continuously cough up money to use it. This is one of those apps. A company like Adobe with all their video\/photo applications and cloud services? Sure. This (and most other apps on the AppStore)? No. I support most subscription based apps with a 1 star rating.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Warning: Do not buy the yearly subscription. I paid for a subscription on my iphone. It keeps asking me to pay again. I hit restore purchases and it crashes. This has been going on for months. The website will not send me an email to reset my password or let me log in. No way to contact them to rectify the issue. Stay away.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Great app where you can set your limits and it will quickly inform you if you are outside those limits. But like any other weather report it is not all accurate. The support for this app is awesome, I emailed with an issue and shortly after I received a response with a fix.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This App works great to check weather conditions.  Be careful though because the upgrade button is very close to the home button.  I have no problem supporting developers for their hard work but accidentally paying $23.99 for an upgrade?  Maybe a bit steep in my opinion.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Just loaded the latest version.  Only large airports show up on map regardless of my threshold settings.  Noticed it on last version too but this fix came out quickly.   This app which was my go to is now undependable.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

It is presented in an easy to understand, unobscured format that will let you know within seconds if you\u2019re good to fly. \n\nThe app is simple, clean, accurate and easy to use. It provides the average enthusiast with everything they need to check before flying all in one convenient space. Not to mention, it\u2019s customizable to fit your needs or the restrictions of your UAV. \n\nCan\u2019t recommend this app enough. It\u2019s just what I was looking for. I will continue to recommend this to all UAV users.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This has always been my favorite app for UAV flying. I thought we lost it on iOS 9.3.5., but the last  update fixed it. Kudos!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The developer just released a patch because one guy complained about the app not working on iOS 9 anymore! Talk about quality customer service. The app itself is great and can be understood in a moment with easy green or red colored sections. If you\u2019re a UAV enthusiast pick up this app, you won\u2019t regret it.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I love the layout of this app! Except that today my ceiling is at 227' agl. UAV Forecast says I'm good to go.  But I have to maintain 500' below that ceiling. I'm not good to go. That is a critical omission.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I had the app installed on two devices, on my iPad the wind was set at an altitude of 10m and on my iphone at 30m. Now, with the new wind profile this is redundant.\n\nWhat a brilliant, superb app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Love the new wind profile tab, this is my most frequently referenced app for UAS operations. Long time users, many thanks to the dev for the nicely done app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Just updated to ver. 1.6.3 (April 14) and NOTHING WORKS!! Can't fetch conditions or forecast!! I even deleted and reinstalled... same results. #FAIL","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The features it offers are great in terms of information covered is basically everything you could need to know before flying. However the app never figures out my location even after typing it in and that usually renders it useless. I love the thought put into this app for pilots, it just needs some fine tuning in order to work. I haven't experienced the charge window problem which I am hoping is simply a glitch and not a purposeful act. I am however afraid to log in since this was supposed to be a free app with the OPTION of an extended forecast and VIP type purchase plan, but it is automatically charging people for using it. Thanks for your listening ear. Safe flying everyone!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Once you close the app, all custom settings are lost. I'll be looking for an alternative. This is one to pass on.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Puts a window up to touch to buy. Can't exit without hitting button which charges you 23.99. This app is theft!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I have been using UAV Forecast for a couple weeks and generally liked it.\n\nAfter updating last night, I went to open it and check wind conditions for today. Without tapping ANYWHERE, the app put up a confirmation to purchase the $23.99 \"Hobby Subscription\" at the same time I was pressing the home button to go back to the home screen.\n\nI'm an app developer myself and have no problem paying for apps, but this was SO scummy ... avoid this app AT ALL COSTS. I intend to wage war against this app with Apple and on every drone forum possible.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"You can tell whoever made it put alot of time into it.  Well done.  Wish it had a option for non military time (12 hr).","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"important tool every responsible pilot should use. I've used there web site for about 6 months but the app is not even comparable. Real time wind speeds at every altitudes. (Just my favorite feature so far). Many, many more cool features.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Updates every hour with weather and no flying zones, even temporary no flying zones, and with it the explanation why you can't fly there. This is THE best app if you are an owner of a UAV\/Drone\/quadcopter. With this app you always know when and where to fly!! Must have!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"By far, this is the best UAV app I have seen so far. I was looking for something to forecast the weather, wind and also display the various no fly zones for drone flying. I have not found another app that will give you hour by hour details on flying conditions like this.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great app with tons of features however the no fly zones are incorrect and do not always show up. Use a separate app for that.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I've been searching for drone apps and never saw this one until typing uav.\n\nThis has everything I was looking for and more! I was looking for a winds aloft app, this allows the altitude to be entered and it calculates Hourly wind estimates. I love the hourly GPS and solar storm prediction as well. I have mainly been using foreflight for winds aloft and TRFs. I combine this with the app \"zone\" to see where small helipads are as well.\n\nI'll buy a subscription to keep up the good work!\n\nNot all airports need a 5 mile radius.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I love how you can set your conditions and the app will tell you if it's good to fly or not. I check it all the time. Only thing I would change is making the No Fly Zones to be 5 miles around airports instead of 3.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I used and relied heavily on the web based version.  Told many of my RC friends about it.  Always found it to be very reliable and accurate and planned what days I'd be flying based on it.  Very excited about the app version.  Even better!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Loved using the web service, now this app makes it even easier.\nLatest update brought location search, so you aren't limited to local information!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"App very easy to use. Waited for something like this for a long time. Now I don't have to use the website.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Tried many apps but this one gives me what I want. If the developer can add some more features that would be great.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Not a day goes by when I don\u2019t focus my attention on the moon.

Very nice work.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Very limited, shows only the phase of the moon for each day, graphics are horrible. Not worth the money. Lost my moon app when I got rid of my old iPad.

{"body":"It\u2019s easy to get the information I want. Nice graphics. A good replacement for Moon Phase, and at a just-right price.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is the coolest and easiest to use app- the graphics and calendar forecasts help us plan \u2018full moon view\u2019 parties on our rooftop deck in Denver, CO every spring and summer! Love it","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app became one of the BEST Moon Apps, after adding NEW & Full Moon Time.\nContinue your success with best regards.\n\nIn your latest update, when touching the moons in the lower areas then they give times for the clicked Moon in iPhone; but in iPad never get the times for first quarter, full Moon, last quarter, and New Moon. Will you correct these for iPad.\nThanks","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I had an old app called Moon Phase. But after the software updates on my iPad the old app doesn\u2019t work anymore. So I wound up downloading 6 different apps.

With all this said this is a nice app and of the 6 this would rank #2.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I reviewed about two dozen moon apps. This is the third one I've used and the first I've purchased. One of the other apps was incorrect on the days\/stages, one made me jump through hoops to get to the current stats. Both were free, so... this one is quick and easy to use and accurate. Works for me!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Perfect app for astrophotographers who always want to know exactly when the moon rises to spoil their shots and when it sets so they can get back to business.  Closeup and monthly overview a great help.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I really like this app,\n\nHowever I purchased it so that I could have an accurate view of the moon is location from a sidereal perspective.\n\nUnfortunately that feature stopped working and it's showing the moon as having been an Aries for a week now.\n\nI'll come back with a sparkling review and a five star rating once that's been corrected.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I love using this app!!!  I plan drum circles and letting go ceremonies for myself and my clients. So useful!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"In the Full Moon app the indication of distance is confusing.  Presently distance is shown as 246.99 mi.  I presume this is meant to indicate a distance of 246,99x miles, but proper formatting would be appreciated.  Also, the formatting of dates on the recap of recent and upcoming new, full and quarter moons is non-standard and confusing.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The parallax effect is well executed. The app needs some work. A \"Today\" button would help greatly, instead of having to slide back to the current date. Setting a default start up screen Current Moon phase vs. Month view would be awesome!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I follow the cycles of the moon each month and this app is very helpful in keeping track when the moon cannot be seen in the sky","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Reliable and helpful. Provides basic information on times of rising and setting for both sun and moon.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Besides being easy to use I love this app because I can see a month at a glance when the next full moon will be as well as all of the moon phases--new, quarters, waxing, waning.   In addition I was able to transfer the different moon phases into my calendar for years to come.  It also has a wealth of other information such as moon rise and set at my location, phase, zenith, zodiac, distance, visibility, etc.  incredible depth of information.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Look no further. This is the one you want!  Beautiful interface, well designed, universal \/ HD app all for a fair price.  Not flooded with astrology like other moon apps.  The Developer responded quickly and valued my feedback! Can't wait for the additional astronomical data and Solstice \/ Equinox.  (This will help with Nisan 14 calculation)","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Made with love, great design with nice images of the moon. Another great one from this developer. \n\nUpdate: keeps getting better with the new version","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I have always been interested in weather but have wanted a forecast app for all three platforms. Forecast Bar provides for all Apple platforms and allows the choice of two excellent sources of data - either The Weather Company or Dark Sky. The interface is very configurable and is essentially the same on a Mac or iPhone. There are separate subscriptions for the MacOS and iOS platforms (the iOS subscription covers Apple Watch) but their rates aren't prohibitively expensive. I really like what Forecast Bar has done. It might be nice to someday be able to choose from multiple locations on WatchOS but that's such a small point as to make it a non-issue. Great job Higher Bar!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is visually the best. It takes the data from Dark Sky and then outs it in an incredibly simple yet customizable package. Two significant issues; 1. Radar is very slow to load and 2. Alerts don't work; you get alerts but when you open them they always say Null. Fix these issues and this is the best weather app, until then it makes it difficult to use.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This is the best. No gimmicks. It\u2019s very clean and accurate. Has a widget and great Apple Watch app. Couldn\u2019t find one that checks all the boxes. I am really impressed. No one asked me to give this review. Just want to give good feedback do it gets downloaded more and they continue support for it. Try it.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The interface and functionality are wonderfully detailed, both on the phone and my watch. I love the customization and widget functionality. The weather is very accurate and I love the alert customization. My only gripes, which sadly, are deal breakers for me are 1) The radar is very slow to load compared to other apps such as My Radar and The Weather Channel. And 2) I can't use this app on my apple watch (series 3) without having to connect to my phone's Bluetooth! Every other weather app I've used allows me to use them without my phone needing to be present, why doesn't this one! If you make this app standalone usable with the apple watch, I will give it five stars and make it my go-to weather app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"It\u2019s ok, used to be better. Huge difference in weather between dark sky and the weather company. \n\nAnd on dark sky the weather alerts don\u2019t give any information. Reads (null).\n\nAs an update; I\u2019ve emailed support twice with no response. Time to move on I think.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"My free trial has ended and now it\u2019s no longer loading anything, I love the details this app has and I wished that there was an option to turn on the badge on the app itself and not needing the MacOS for iCloud as I don\u2019t use iCloud.\n\nOtherwise great app!  :)","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I couldn\u2019t agree more with the person who said this app is a classic \u201cbait and switch.\u201d I saw NOTHING about this being a \u2018trial offer\u2019 or that certain features would be unavailable in a short time.\n\nWithin a few days or so, it showed that the RADAR was no longer available, but I could upgrade to the premium version. I found this very strange and quite unbelievable. Then, shortly after this, it said the app was not available unless I upgraded.\n\nThere MAY be other apps like this around, but I\u2019ve NEVER seen one quite this disgusting and deceitful. They want to wet your appetite and then pull the plug so they can get more money. This stinks and I feel it is an underhanded tactic. I don\u2019t care what the so-called developers claim, this is a bait and switch and would NEVER buy the premium version from a company that operates in this manner. I would never recommend it, either. Just the opposite in fact.\n\nFrankly, I don\u2019t see anything special about the weather app. I have about a dozen weather apps and there is nothing laudable about this app. It seems very ordinary in terms of other weather apps and as I said I would NEVER recommend it. Shoddy tactics as I, and another reviewer, see it !\n\nI see the so-called \u201cDeveloper\u201d has now added a response. I had checked my review a number of times over a period of time and saw no response. It looks like my review is now on the front page of the App listing which may have prompted them to finally respond.\n\nI find their response completely disingenuous and insulting. It looks like the same response they repeatedly post. We\u2019re I the only one or one of only a FEW who have made the same complaint, their pat response might have more believability. As it stands, MANY people have made the same complaint which should be a clue to them.  Frankly, I\u2019m surprised that the App Store allows this sort of tactic. It\u2019s not just the overall rating that should be important, but the sheer number of people who have had the same complaint and that is a LOT. It is a bait and switch tactic and it\u2019s not above board. Suffice to say, I didn\u2019t pay for the premium version as I find their approach to be highly questionable.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

I\u2019m a paid (annual) Full Access + Watch subscriber but the watch app doesn\u2019t even show up. I\u2019ve written to the dev multiple times and received no response at all. Not even an acknowledgement of receipt. An app that doesn\u2019t give what you paid for, and a dev that won\u2019t even respond to requests for support doesn\u2019t merit a good rating, even when the basics of the app are fine.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"**UPDATED 6\/5\/18**\n\nThe latest small updated seems to have fixed the issues. Original review stands. \n\n**UPDATED 6\/1\/18**\n\nI was excited to finally see an update and paid for a month. As you can probably guess by the removal of a star that the updated fixed nothing. The Apple Watch complication hasn\u2019t updated in over 8 hours. Frequency is on fastest and did a clean install after just updating fixed nothing. Avoid this app for the Apple Watch. Stick with carrot. At the very least don\u2019t pay for a year if you don\u2019t believe me just do a month better off losing $1 instead of $5. I have an Apple Watch series 3 and an 8 Plus combo. \n\n*UPDATED REVIEW**\nI have to take off 3 stars due the Apple Watch, which is my main use for Forecast Bar, the complication no longer updates at least not often. To get the complication to update the watch app needs to be opened then it takes a while to load, close the app reopen and wait force close the watch app open the phone app then open the watch app again and wait then that only works half the time. I tried uninstalling the main and watch app to no avail. I moved to Carrot Weather that is now the premier top tier watch complication and weather app. I\u2019ll be more than happy to come back to Forecast Bar but it\u2019s been at least a half year since it worked properly. I had hopes for the update 4 months ago but nothing changed. \n\n*ORIGINAL REVIEW*\nBy far the best Weather app for the watch. Very customizable complication and highest quality weather app on the watch. The widget is also incredible you can add as much or little info as you want. This gets a perfect score for the watch highly recommended for anyone needing a weather app for that.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

Also, the overlays don\u2019t work well, either and reappear and disappear randomly. Ick. \nIn addition, they answered questions for me until I bought the app. Then they stopped communicating with me after they got my money.\nApple Watch app doesn\u2019t work well but it\u2019s the prettiest when it actually does work. Updating it is slow and it just doesn\u2019t do it reliably whatsoever, even when you request for the update. \nOverall if I had to do it again I would not buy it.

The interface is clean in general, and you can add or remove fields on information if you want more or less to be visible from a glance. I think this app is worth the subscription, though many people want everything for free. Most weather apps have a boring or gaudy UI, are somewhat accurate, and have ads, with an option to pay to remove ads... that\u2019s all. \n\nForecastBar has served me perfectly. I\u2019ve used Accuweather, The Weather Channel app, and the Apple Weather app, among others. Forecast Bar beats them all hands-down.\n\nThe developers even went above and beyond for me with a recent update: I have my version of the app customized to avoid affecting my night vision (light discipline. red text on black) but a prior update made the phone go bright white while loading, which defeated my purposes. I emailed the developers, and they made the screen go black on startup instead of white. Problem solved, and most other people probably didn\u2019t realize, or necessarily care, but it made a huge difference for me.\n\nForecast Bar has never given me much of a reason to complain. Even when I did have an issue, though minor, it was fixed within days. Definitely a satisfied customer!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I love this weather app. It's extremely customizable and displays weather information very clearly. I would be happy to pay for it, but as a one time charge. I don't like how the developer wants to charge an annual subscription.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Versatile views let me see the details that matter in the moment. For example, wind speed. Keeps tapping and scrolling to a minimum. Nice integration of alerts and radar. Desktop app for Mac makes it a consistent interface across my devices.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The app does a decent job of displaying the information in an easy to read and use format. However, the glaring issue is it merely pulls its info from the Dark Sky developer but then wants an ongoing annual subscription.  Personally, I would much rather purchase Dark Sky for a fair onetime fee than pay this developer an ongoing subscription to display another app's info. If this developer would have charged a single fee rather than a subscription, it would have done much better.  Eventually the updates will stop and the few people who did pay for this app will be left with a dead app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I use this app everyday since the rain and bad weather has returned to Northern California, it's the most accurate weather app I have.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Intuitive design that looks gorgeous and works beautifully. \n\nThe developers are very responsive and are continually making the app better.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I love this app. Have it on my Mac and iPhone and iPad. Even paid extra on Mac for more frequent updates. BUT...the 3 apps won't sync like they're supposed to.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This is the wx app I've been looking for. Clear, concise information assembled for easy reading. My new go-to weather app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"One of my go to weather apps.\nHave it on all my iPad and Mac too.\nHaven't run into any bugs, love the detail and presentation. Recommended.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I've always been extremely happy with this app. It presents the Dark Sky weather data is a conviennent and clear user interface.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Most complete weather app, not sure annual subscription is worth the cost.  It is one of the best of it's kind.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Leaving aside the fact I feel duped after the seven day 'free' trial, this app is a joke. It takes forever to load, crashes at start up too many times to count, and is plain inaccurate. Yes the breadth of detail is nice, but as has been said, there is nothing here that you can't find elsewhere for free. I have a calendar date for the expiry of my use of this app. I shall be declining to support when that day arrives.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app cost me money up front when I purchased the tvOS version of the app, but is apparently free up front with later in-app purchases with the iOS version of the app. Why didn't the developer link the iOS app to the tvOS app and handle them both the same way? $$$ perhaps? When I purchase something, as I did with the tvOS version of this app, I expect the transaction to be complete and the product to work properly on all supported platforms (including iOS) once the transaction is complete. I am not interested in hidden purchases later. Just link all platforms as the same app,  charge the necessary cost up front, and be done with it. Don't bother me later for more money. Otherwise, I really like this app, and would have liked to give it 5 stars.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"If the size of the text was configurable. Text is so tiny in the widget it hurts my eyes. Please, please size the text for us old timers. Otherwise I just can't renew my annual subscription when my current one expires. Sorry.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Ever since the Weather Channel did away with their \"Pro\" app I was in the weather app doldrums.  The \"Pro\" app was so simple & straightforward ... I didn't have to hunt for the info I wanted.  Dark Sky came close ... &  finally Forecast Bar came along.  I can arrange the info exactly as I want it & ... it is a pleasing app to look at.  Love it, thanks!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is a decent app, push notifications work well and the layout is nice but yearly subscription service...really? I'd gladly pay a one time fee but the subscription service needs to be rethought. Might as well just purchase Dark Sky.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This is the best weather app in the app store imo. The among of customization and information presented is definitely the best. \n\nWith that said I have experienced a few issues. For one, daily push notifications sometimes fail to come through. Some days I will get them and others I won't. Also the some watch app crashes every now and then. Finally, I wish the radar was a little smoother. \n\nWith all that said I would still recommend this weather app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Really like this weather app. No problems to date. One of my top 5.  Just went to my top 3 since dark sky nose dived ESP on iPad.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This weather app claims all sorts of things and has a subscription.  I like to pay once and be done. One day last week it showed a bright sun and it was pouring outside. Dark sky said it was raining but this missed it. Go figure.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"It gives a very detailed weather forecast. The only thing I would like to see (hear) is an audible alert for lighting in my selected area (we've been hit by lightning WAY too often).  Accurate and easy to personalize.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Would have gladly paid a one time fee, maybe even up to $4.99 to get access after the one week trial but not going to do an ongoing subscription. There are simply too many choices in the App Store. Nice weather app...but not THAT nice. You guys need to get in the board room and have someone make an executive decision to change to a one time fee. If 99% of the other weather app developers can offer a product on one-time fees, I'm sure you guys can as well.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Nice program and it works well. But it is really not free as they want you to pay a yearly subscription. Price on it is not bad but paying for others repackaged data does not seem right. Program has been deleted.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This was offered for free on Apps Gone Free.  I downloaded it & told my friends how much I liked it & to get it while it was free. \nWell, now I have egg on my face!  It was \"free\" for only a week. Then they locked it & demanded an annual subscription to unlock it. \nI don't think so!!!\nIt might be worth a one time fee, but definitely not a subscription!  \nThe developer is just being greedy.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I've had this app for a week and like it. It seems accurate and works for me very well. It has all information I need. As long as it is accurate I'm happy. That's what it's all about. After a longer time I still like the app. It has been my go to app. Seems very accurate and has all the information I need. I recommend it!!!\n\nIt's been quite a while since my rating. I still give it 5 stars.  I like the updates   Dark Sky is good but I don't like their map.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This developer charges for background updates - a core function for a weather app - across all the devices they support. So not only do you pay for the app itself, you'll pay annually for simple background updating. It is a despicable cash grab. There are PLENTY of free or less expensive options out there. I'm deleting my apps and requesting refunds.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I pay for apps, and not just 99\u00a2. This app, while pretty, was not useful enough (for free) for me to open more than 3-4 times in the 3 weeks I had it. Whatever, it was free and I was too lazy to delete it. \n\nUpdate, holds the app ransom for $3-$5. There was zero warning beforehand. Do the update and you must pay to play. Seeing no value, I'm not playing. Your mileage may very.\n\nI will continue using Dark Sky--efficient, useful, paid for it gladly.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The fact that this app is so customizable and pulls data from the Frame IO site makes it the strongest weather app around. The new update is great too. Sure you gotta pay, but it's worth it.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Apple Watch app never worked right. Crashes and complication did not refresh and app wants a subscription. I'd a stay away","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Should be more upfront about it being a limited time free trial. If it surprised anybody, it is a bad experience.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I am a weather app junky.  I have tried them all.  And even the good ones always seemed to lack one thing.  Forecast Bar is perfect!  Primarily because you can customize it any way you like.  You can customize look, icons, what info is displayed, alerts - you can even customize the map source!  You can customize the widget and choose what you want displayed.  You can customize the 3D touch!  You can customize what the complicaton looks like on the Apple Watch!  \n\nThis is the same data source as Dark Sky, which is good.  I always hated the Dark Sky map, and Forecast Bar solves that!  Free trial for a week but worth the money.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"They got me. It was a recommended Free app. Then they pulled they \"Your free trial has ended\". A yearly subscription fee?  Great if you want to pay that. If not, look elsewhere.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Apps Gone Free offered the app as a \"free\" app which in reality was a free trial. Conveniently missing in the description of the app was that the free usage was only for s trial period wherein a paid subscription is required after the free trial period to continue using the app. I have deleted the app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I thought I got the \"pay for\" app instead of the free app at no cost as a promotional deal. I explored and set my new app up and I liked its layout.... Then a week later I open it only to discover that it's frozen on a 'pay up' screen. That's crap!  There are tons of FREE weather apps out there and many freebies have a nicer radar than this one. When I find an app I really like, I am willing to pay for an upgrade....ONCE!  I WONT pay for it every stinking year!!!  DELETED!!!! \ud83d\ude21","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I got this app \"free\" when it was offered free for a day. It is an ok app but there is no way I will pay a yearly subscription for it! Who do you think you are?","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This is a decent weather app on macOS and when I saw the iOS go from $4 to free I thought it was worth checking out. I was not pleased to find that a few days later it stopped working and wanted a $3\/yr subscription. Well, that might be reasonable, but they could have warned me that this would happen instead of pretending it was free. That gives a bad taste it is hard to get rid of. Whoever decided to hide the change shouldn't be deciding these things. Frankly, the main weather screen is nice, but the thousands of customizations are annoying. Pick some nice settings for me and leave me alone. I have not yet decided if I will subscribe or not, probably not as it seems a bit steep for a marginally above average experience. For $3-4 this is a decent one-payment app, but an annual subscription at that level is too high for what I've seen. I might come back to it later, but for now it isn't that appealing.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Great weather app especially if you have the Apple Watch it is an added bonus. Love it. Worth the price.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I wanted to love this app, I really did.  I gave it a chance testing it for a few weeks.  The UI is gorgeous and I think part of the allure in weather app\u2019s is how the info is presented.  This app nails that.  That being said\u2026\n\nThis is a terrible model for pay to play.  I was unaware just how locked down this app was until the free trial ran out and you needed to unlock the app just to get access.  On top of that just to get access to sections such as radar and watch requires another purchase.  I\u2019m reasonable and understand the need for paid apps.  I think the devs could do a better job explaining what is included up front and what you get when you sign up for a subscription.  \n\nI wanted this app to replace Dark Sky.  It falls short in that it needs a host device such as a Mac or a Watch to forward push notifications.  Considering the amount of money you pay for a yearly subscription this seems like something that can be implemented and explained much better.\n\nI think this app has potential but the devs need to rethink the business model.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This \"free\" app is a joke and a waste of time. The casual game developer played a \"casual game\" of getting people to Download the app and the. Hit them up for subscription fees a week later. Thanks but no","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app is pretty nice and looks great. I'm uninstalling it now because it's a one year subscription that I didn't know about till today. Pretty dumb.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"It's not optional in app purchase with limited features. It's buy in or nothing, and more for the watch. Plenty of good free weather apps with more. A deceptive marketing joke.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Checked this app out cause it was free for a day.  Well actually only 7 days then....  it holds all of its info as hostage until you pay up to buy a subscription... this app lets you customize the way you can get the info but the info is no different than similar free apps already out there. I'd give more stars if it at least ran adds in the app so it was still usable without a subscription.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"From free to subscription and extra of you want it to be displayed on your watch! I don't mind a one time fee but subscription for weather is a bit ridiculous! I do like the app and the layout it provides but I can't go above one star until they get rid of the subscription.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"No! Why would you pay for what you can get for onetime payment or free. It just stopped working went from 5-1star.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I had a week free trial and really liked the design and layout. It was my favorite weather app for my watch as well, since it showed the current temperature in big numbers. When my free trial ran out, I was all set to pay for it. Then I saw that it was an annual subscription fee. Really? No thanks. If this was a one time purchase, it's a no brainer...I'd buy it.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"The information they offer is great and if this had been a one time purchase I would have gotten the app and given it five stars but paying a subscription for what a lot of other apps give you at no charge or a one time charge just isn't worth it...","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"It will not fetch your data until you subscribe \nWhich I think is pretty ridiculous and uncool why don't they just get rid of In app purchases it is just a big waste of time and money it also would even make sense to have the extra features for just a month I bet the money doesn't even go to the developer and goes to some random app if it is fixed by next update it will be better.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Watch displays a big water drop icon instead of the weather. Useless. Apple's built in Weather app is much more reliable and useful","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Nice looking and functional app. But, then, there are the two available yearly subscriptions. Upon seeing this the app was deleted. Can't say about others but this one is getting tired of these types of subscription models. Otherwise, this app looks and feels great.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I downloaded this from Appsgonefree. Then looked in the settings and found that it's only free for a few days, and then we have to pay a subscription fee. False advertising! I wasted my time downloading the app, because now I have to delete it.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This company makes some great apps, the business model on this one is broken though.  A seven day trial followed by $4\/year?  I like to reward developers for their efforts, but this pricing isn't in line with competitive offerings.  Deleting app wishing them the best of luck.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Like a drug dealer, first ones free.\n\nIt looks good. Does what I want... but subscription fee? C'mon guys. There's a million weather apps out there that deliver the same information free.

AccuWeather also provides wonderfully accurate information.\n\nI'm deleting this app now.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Seems accurate and I love all the customizable options. My only complaint is that I'd like to see an option to change locations on the watch app. Maybe via force touch. Otherwise the amount of info you get on the watch app is second to none. Thanks for the great app!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"I think inbuilt this app myself. I can't believe it has everything I've always said a weather app needs. Looks great , customizable to the hilt just unbelievable. And from dark sky. Great job. Don't change a thing.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I do not deny the nice look and unique customization ability but I wonder why an app of $3.99 needs in app purchases! Unless the developers are the forecasting company which I doubt so I classify this app among the trash.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I downloaded the app because it looked great and was free today and with my profession I need to track weather. However in going through the settings the app told me I only had authorization through October. I should've been told it was a only a free app for a month.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Just downloaded this app and haven't had time to fully appreciate it yet, but I like everything I've seen so far. \n\nTwo requests:  \n\n1) Can you add a future aspect to the weather radar?  I use that all the time on TWC app and it's extremely handy for making outdoor plans. If you had this capability I would only have to have your app on my phone and I would be grateful. \n\n2) Hurricane Matthew is currently ravaging the coast of Florida and I would love to see what's going on there in realtime. I don't have a lot of time to \"play\" (meaning go online, Google \"watch live streaming traffic web cameras in Fort Lauderdale,\" then try to find a real live streaming webcam so I can see what I want to see). I know there must be be other types of live cameras that show weather conditions and are accessible online, but I can rarely find them because I don't know the key words to Google. I suspect you are more savvy about that?\n\nIn any case, it would be wonderful to be able to pick a city or state in your app and be presented with a list of live cameras to choose from to see the weather there.  I (and probably many others) would be grateful for this capability and it would endear this app to me for life. \n\nIn any case, great app!  Well done!!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"You have to pay an ongoing subscription fee to get updates in the background. Otherwise, this won't notify you of storms and freezing. This is just a bloated short term forecast then that you can get from any other app or site for free if you don't subscribe.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The app works well. However, I can't justify spending $4 for the app,  and an additional yearly fee of $4 for the complication functionality.

I especially like how you get a consistent experience across devices with their companion apps, even on OS X and the Apple TV. That's nice and something I haven't found with other weather apps. Plus the devs are really responsive to users (something I really appreciate) and constantly - I mean constantly - adding new features. Every time I turn around something new is added.

{"body":"The latest iteration of this app is superb. I've gone through many apps and I simply wanted a straightforward and easy to use app with all the information. The app does it without anything fancy and it's easy to access information.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I've been using their Mac app for some time and really liked it. I was glad to see that the developers had ported the Mac app over to iOS. It works really well and is always accurate for me, relying on Forecast.io data. The only thing it's missing from the Mac version are severe weather notifications. That's the only reason I still have my previous weather app installed. Once it gets those, it would be perfect for my needs.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Update: Push alerts were added!!! Just a superb app and goes well with my Apple Watch!!!This is a fantastic weather app.  Purchased the Mac version as well. Lots of features, pretty accurate, and well organized. As soon as the \"push\" severe weather alerts are added, I will have no need for any other weather app. Great job!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is the best weather app on the app store. And trust me, I've been looking for good ones for a while now. I used Yahoo Weather for a long time, but got tired of them not adding 3D touch and jumped ship to this one. It's the only app that has 3D touch quick actions, peek and pop within the app, a today widget that shows the daily highs and lows, and a clean minimalist interface with no ads. Wunderground came close, but this app's UI wins hands down. I understand the need to charge for background updates as well; API calls aren't cheap! Especially with forecast.io. If you've been looking for the perfect weather app, you've already found it. This one is exactly what I've been looking for since I first got an iPhone.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"When it works it really cool. But I live in Houston TX., and my watch resets itself to the Cupertino, CA. - frequently!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Nice app - if you live near a weather station. I live in the mountains of North Carolina, and right now Forecast Bar indicates that it's 41 degrees out - my thermometer says 22, and my birdbath is frozen solid. It turns out that the data is coming from Morganton, which is 57 miles away and NOT in the mountains. I'll go back to using WeatherBug - which uses a network of local weather reporting stations such as schools and small airports.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Watch complications rarely function (after in app purchase). This uses Dark Sky\/Forecast.io data. Go with the original and save five bucks.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"It should allow a default location without constantly trying to determine my location. I do not allow any app to know my location. While it lets me set zip codes it should default to those if desired. Instead, every time I open the app it is stupid enough to look for my location first which means I get a blank page every time I start it.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Best weather app in terms of accuracy, ease of use, and stability. Love the Mac menu bar version, the iPad version, and the iPhone version. The app is cross platform as far as preferences and cities. The time machine is a fun element. I've tried many and the others can't touch the look, feel, and functionality of Forecast.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Nice app, except the part where you charge another 4 bucks just so it will refresh in the background!! And that's PER year! \n\nMisleading for sure. Why? Because the watch app is useless without the app updating in the background! \n\nSo 8 bucks the first year, and 4 every year after that...","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"So much potential, so little production. Even after PAYING EXTRA for the watch updates, it just doesn\u2019t work folks. I own this app on mac, Apple TV, Phone, iPad, watch. It could be the best, now just quit working on selling it and focus on making if function flawlessly!\nOh yeah, and NEVER show me another ad again.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Love app itself! BUT...won't successfully load widget on iPhone 6s Plus even though I've seen multiple updates saying that feature has been improved. Loads widget on iPad Air. VERY annoying.

Your prior radar was so visually striking and beautifully animated...now you just look like everyone else...boring.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I've been using the desktop version for a while and love it. I also love the iOS app, however, the widget ALWAYS says unable to load, even after the latest update and whenever there is a severe weather warning, I never get notifications until I open the app. I'm running iOS Beta 9.3 version 4\n\nUntil these are fixed, it cannot get a 5th star.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Visually stunning and also the most functional app on the market. Provides daily push notifications for any time I want to properly prepare for the day.

{"body":"I was really happy with this app. Still think it's great. Really excited to see the improvements for the watch, until I see I need to pay$3.99 a year for the complications to work properly. Dark Sky doesn't charge an annual fee. Get real.  Minus two stars.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"As others have stated this app is beautiful, functional and accurate. However, I'm having the same problem as everyone else with the widget not loading. Even after the latest update that is supposed to improve widget reliability it still keeps giving me an error saying that I need to enable location access (which I have).","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Day 3 of Forecast Bar & I've already bought the Mac version. It's clean, accurate & at home in iOS. The widget had some issues but the customer service staff responded immediately & fixed the issue.

{"body":"I'm always looking for a weather app... I'm obsessed lol weather underground has all of the features but its accuracy can be sketchy... This so far has been spot on","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"So i contacted them cause the notification was not working well all he told me nothing hd can do and ask apple for a refund! So be aware with this issue and dont get the app!!!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Yeah, I'm a weather geek. Tried just about every app and none of 'em present all the weather you need in such a user friendly, logical, easy to access format! The last weather app you'll ever need.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I've been using this app on my iMac and enjoying it. I was happy to see it come to iPhone and iPad. It's working well so far but could use some improvements to make it a bit more user friendly on iOS. It is a great start though. Looking forward to future updates.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I have had this app on my Mac for over a year and it is the most accurate I have ever used. Down to the minute rain predictions and very good with snow. Alerts are also great. I have not used the it on iOS for any length of time but I'm hoping for the same quality.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I don't write reviews often, but the few times I do it's because I'm blown away. This is one of those apps. I've had the Mac version for months a really enjoy it, because it's like having Dark Sky on my desktop. Now with the iOS version it's even better:\n\n1.) great Notification Center widget\n2.) 3D Touch support both on home screen and peek\/pop in app\n3.) super accurate info that's easy to read and understand \n\nA few features I want to see in the future:\n1.) Apple Watch app with complications \n2.) rain notifications that push\n3.) severe weather alerts that push\n\nWith these features it's honestly the only weather app I'd need!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Get your local weather in a clear, straight forward manner. Everything is there and easy to access. If you love the Mac version, as I do, then this is a must have. The only downside is the lack of landscape view on the iPad.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I have been using the Mac version since day 1. Was happy to see it available now for iOS. One thing I would like to see in the iOS version is the ability to run the app in landscape mode on my iPad.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I've been using the Mac version of Forecast Bar and fell in love. I'm so happy it's now available for my iPhone; clearly the best weather app available.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The layout is very clean. I find the line graphs to be very intuitive. Being able to have the same app on my Mac and iPhone aids me in keeping my weather data consistent. \n\nAnother thing I enjoy is having the pressure displayed in mb AND inHg.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"DarkSky on steroids...this is an EXCELLENT app that is accurate, user-friendly, and with tons of easy to utilize features that bring weather apps to a whole other level!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This WAS my favorite barometer app until the GOP POLITICAL ADS started coming up.  \u201cSign the petition to stop illegal immigration\u201d.  NOPE!  Not on my device!  DELETED!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I have an illness that gets worse with barometric changes. When it gets low, it gets really bad. Flying is hard because of the low cabin pressure. \nI  able to watch it and prepare for the drops. I used it on the plane and it showed what I was feeling. It totally verified what I\u2019ve been saying for years. \nI\u2019m sharing this app with friends who suffer from my illness. All I can say is THANK YOU THANK YOU!!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Pleased thus far. the cloud locations on the dial face  are very broad. @ 29.8 trending down means rain. Would suggest the next clockwise cloud from the 11 o\u2019clock cloud indicate rain. Custom design features are nice! Would recommend this app!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I\u2019ve been looking for a reliable barometer where I could track the changes. All other weather apps I have only gave me the pressure for that one moment, and I certainly do not have time to chart all the changes. For people who get pressure related migraines or other types of headaches due to pressure changes, having this information readily available from the graph is extremely helpful! Now I can track when the headaches occur, and will be able to help predict and prevent them in the future. \nThank you to the developer for this well thought-out wonderful app!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"And the barometer says \u201csunny\u201d and what\u2019s the \u2018feet\u2019 meter all about? That needle is all over the board. \nAm I wrong or does the barometer drop before bad weather?","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I have read the reviews and h e all my setting correct and it is still off and not very accurate. Very disappointed. Wouldn\u2019t get again.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Since I suffer from migraines and have felt there is likely a weather cause to my particular migraine episodes, I bought this app to keep track of wide swings in barometric pressure changes.  This app does this job well and we shall see if weather changes parallel my migraines.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Was looking for an app that would record the pressure on the graph automatically. This one doesn\u2019t, either.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app seems to work well enough for what it does. As previously stated, it seems to be a bit off, but your iPhone isn\u2019t a barometer, so as long as you have the offset corrections set it\u2019s good enough.\n\nMy problem lies in the background app refresh. What I really want to see from this app is the graph of past barometer data so I can track migraines. Unfortunately, for this to work, I have a flashing blue bar across the top of my phone screen constantly that says \u201cBarometer Plus is Actively Using Your Location\u201d, even though it should only be updating every hour. The flashing blue bar is enough to make me close the app, rendering the pressure history useless.\n\nThe developer response solution is not an option as \u201cnever\u201d and \u201cwhile using the app\u201d are the only options regarding location","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"It\u2019s a good app. However, the settings doesn\u2019t have an option to calibrate it. The iPhone internal barometer is about 0.3 to 0.5 mmHg off when it\u2019s compared with a NIST barometer. Therefore, a calibration option will make the app more precise.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"A lot of people claim that their joints ache or levels of chronic pain and fatigue are affected by barometric pressure.  So, I got this ap to start keeping track. It works fine, I guess, I know nothing about barometric pressure.  I sure would like to see this or a new ap include a way of tracking pain levels w barometric changes.  I\u2019m currently using a note pad on my phon to keep records of barometer readings and pain, which works fine, but thinking it might be really great to have an ap that tells me when I might expect to feel like crap, or to at least remind me that the reason I am waking up, feeling like crap is due to atmospheric changes and not because I\u2019m falling apart.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"The trend always defaults back to a 12 hour span. Even when selecting a longer period it will still only show 12 hours until you expand the view. Also, the reference needle on the meter is very hard to move.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Not sure how to set it by zip code as my nearest airport is an hour drive and a state away, also it is consistently off as weatherbug predicts pressure at 30 while this app predicts it under 20!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I've only had this app for a short time and it seems to be accurate. I like the graph that shows the reading in the last 12 hours or by the one or two days.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Nice graphic when you first open it, but it oversimplifies the concept of barometric pressure's impact on weather. Whether it's raining or not has more to do with the trend rather than the actual barometric pressure value. Just because barometric pressure is low doesn't mean it is raining. \nThe timeframe options for the graphics are silly because they only change how far back you can look at barometric pressure data. The graphs should compress the data selected into the same size graphic, one that fits on the screen.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Unless your checking it every 15 minutes to an hour of every day you won't get an accurate if at all idea of the change in pressure. I have migraines based off of the pressure change and this doesn't do anything to actually see the change. Rather, \"here's the pressure is it lower or higher than yesterday who knows.\"","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"User \/ reader friendly,  can not only clearly see the changes in the barometer based on the parameters you set , hourly , daily ect but can view the changes on the graph . Awesome if you want to track migraines based on barometric pressure \/ weather changes .","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"When first opened it seems to be accurate, but when refreshed it seems to be low.  It has a lot of potential to be very helpful for folk with prosthetics as pressure changes can be an indication of oncoming pain, so I really hope he sticks with it.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"From the description, I thought I was going to be able to see pressure trends over time, but it only seems to record a measurement when you open the app. This makes it much less valuable than I had hoped. I had anticipated it would take a r adding once every couple of hours or other user imposed time setting. Alas that is not the case.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Humidity is important to me, especially with a record of past barometric activity.\nThis app does what super-expensive weather recorders do, at an app price. A few instructions would help, but generally a great product that suits my needs at a surprisingly low price.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"Very good app, and better yet, the forecasts are almost always correct.  I have deleted other weather apps.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Too general.  Doesn\u2019t give forecast for my location. Looking at forecast temps that include the Catskill and I\u2019m nowhere near there.  For example, now shows me forecast temps for this evening to be 6 to 26 degrees. What good is that?\nDeleting.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"It annoys me that the radar stopped working. Also, if there's a weather warning or special weather statement you can't read the whole thing from the app. You have to click on the link to the website to read it. To me, that defeats the purpose of having the app. \nOther than that, this is a great app and my go-to for checking weather. It just needs a software update.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"Right up front it tells you what you want to know: the moon age since the last new moon, the exact time\/date of the full mmon or other phase of interest, the time it rises and sets and the percentage illuminated. You can explore for other info. The calendar is accurate. The initial display is updated in real time, like the small clock on your iPhone homepage, that has the time correct up to the second.  The coordinates of the moon\u2019s are available, useful when you can\u2019t see it, and for astrologers you have the zodiac sign and node, etc. Not quite free, it\u2019s 99 cents to unlock the calendar, one of it\u2019s most useful features, but you can see the calendar relative to the current date for free. Well worth it. Try it for a while, then pay $0.99 if you like it, which I did. Great app. The ads are no bother, and some are interesting, so I didn\u2019t spring up $2.99 to be free of ads. Great app, nice ads!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I like to follow the moon cycles so this is a great app to is basic and gets to the point in showing you the placement of the moon. It also shows the sign (zodiac) that the moon is in. I use it often!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I have been using this app for two months now and absolutely love it. I didn\u2019t purchase the app until I knew it would be for me and that I would like and use this app. It does have many in app purchases unfortunately but well worth the price as I use this daily now and love it.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I love how you can just swipe to the left or right and change the calendar day and how the moon appears in the lunar cycle on that particular day.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"the best part of the app is the notifications and updates. whoever runs the app is weird and i love them. and the picture of the moon is super pretty and cool.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"It\u2019s extremely accurate, and it doesn\u2019t buffer. Only downside is that you can\u2019t unlock all of the app unless you pay a certain price. Other than that, it\u2019s great at checking moon phases, and if you\u2019re into knowing astrological moons, it shows that too.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"We are a homeschooling family and we use this app to add the moon phase to our daily calendar time. It is a great resource for keeping track of the night sky in a quick easy way and our kids really like it. It\u2019s easy to use with an easy on the eyes design. Thank you!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Don\u2019t ever ask me to review your app.  I don\u2019t work for you, and can look at the moon myself. I like the app, my daughter likes the app. But Seriously f\u2019ck off with demanding reviews.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This app does what it says on the tin - it shows you the phases of the moon. But you can\u2019t look at future months for free. I understand charging for in-app features, but this information is easily googleable, so it just makes the app useless for people who want to use it plan ahead.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Anyone else notice the constellations are off (possibly by a calendar month)? Ex: the pattern of constellations correlating with the full moon is correct just a month behind. Where Sept. 2018\u2019s full moon should fall in Aries, the app shows it in Pisces. Oct. 2018 is showing Pisces when it should be Taurus. Nov. 2018 is showing Taurus when it should be Gemini. Am I missing something? Is there a setting I need to adjust? Are there any other minor discrepancies that others have found that might affect the apps accuracy? \n\nI love the idea of the app. But if it\u2019s inaccurate it makes it ineffective.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

I used to have another app before this one but the developer is gone and the app doesn\u2019t anymore update. It was called Moonphase, and you could set it to howl to remind you of the impending full moon. I thought that was fun and quirky, I wish this app had that because I truly miss it so. It was just a fun thing to have and joke around and show people. Maybe if you find the developer and work something out and add it to this?

{"body":"It\u2019s a simple, great app. I love it. But there are so many parts blocked off unless you pay to unlock and it\u2019s really ridiculous. There is no reason the app isn\u2019t all around free, you shouldn\u2019t  have to pay for those features. And it\u2019s super easy to accidentally tap to purchase which isn\u2019t cool. Other than that I love it though and use only the free stuff and it is enough. No crazy adds that take away from the experience which is nice. If an app comes along with free in house moon charts I will drop this for that in an instant.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"My purpose for having the app is for tracking the phases of the moon during the month , and it works great.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"I first got this app because I play video games that observe the actual Moon cycles.\n One, \u201cteam fortress-two\u201d that allows you to equip certain cosmetic items only during a Full moon or on Halloween And another \u201cthe elder scrolls online\u201d\nwhich when the moon is full werewolves will spawn all across the world and you may become one by being injured by them. \n\nHowever I\u2019ve used it sense just to keep track of the Moons cycles I love knowing when there\u2019s going to be a full moon and this does that and more. I use it almost every day just to see where were at in each cycle.\n\nI love this app Legit.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Downloaded this last night and this morning I start getting redirected to fake websites saying I had won a free gift from Amazon or I had 3 viruses on my iPhone from a page that said it was apple security but wasn\u2019t an Apple url. I uninstalled the app and haven\u2019t seen a single scam page since.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Before this app, I had a terrible time keeping track of the moon cycle. I never was the best at science or astronomy. I did my best to learn and I ended up downloading this app to help to process. The moon is an essential part of life for everyone but especially for me. If I can\u2019t tell what night the full moon will be on it will be trouble for all around me. A transformation is a draining process and all I can think about after is FOOD. Doesn\u2019t matter what or who it was. Not many people take into consideration my condition. Turning in to a beast isn\u2019t fun and games, people.

I recommend this app for any targeted individual.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Have had the app for at least a month or two, and so far it is doing just fine! It's helpful for anybody trying to keep track of the lunar phases, and even has extra features for zodiac enthusiasts!! You can purchase and unlock more features, but it's not a must. Overall great app!!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is an outstanding app to use for moon phases. \nI installed this app to use during hunting season. \nIt has been invaluable.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I occasionally like to take pictures of the moon. I like being able to check the percentage of face, the rise and set times, and the waxing and waning. It is nice to be able to go back in time or ahead in time for to categorize or plan for photos.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I use it to plan kayaking and camping trips under a full moon.  The werewolf howl is funny when it just happens unexpectedly. It gives me all the info I need.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

The only missing piece is it doesn\u2019t come with the soundtrack of \u201cDark Side of the Moon\u201d by Pink Floyd.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I think this app is pretty interesting ... I love Science and like to learn about it ! The moon has always interested me...","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Honestly, I love this app... but the constant misspellings and nonsensical sentences are so distracting. It\u2019s clear the person writing the daily info uses google translate or something. \nI would have already deleted this, except I paid for it.

{"body":"I really wanted to give this app five stars and probably would have if I had rated it in the first week or two after I got it. I love apps that do one thing well. This app has a simple, beautiful interface, presents information well, is free and doesn\u2019t have ads. But, it doesn\u2019t do its one thing well! Today, for example (12\/9\/2017), the moon is at 60 percent illumination with eight days til the next new moon, and on the main screen it says \u201cLast quarter.\u201d No-ooo, that\u2019s a waning gibbous moon, not last quarter. This sort of thing happens often.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

Also miss the different names of the moons whether according to Indigenous cultures, Celtic, or Norse. Adds a bit of heritage. \nI really enjoy learning about the Moon, it\u2019s affects on the ebb and  flow of natural living here on Mother Earth.  Thank you to the creators of this app. Number #1.

{"body":"I give this app a one star because the free one is not free. You click on the calendar, oops, pay $2.99. You want no ads, add .99. I just hate this tricky dishonesty. To the developer, List the price, the real price. Don\u2019t play games!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"1) this is an actual sentence from the app: \u201cactivate maximum of you awareness\u201d. Seriously. The whole text about any given day is gibberish that sounds like a bad google translate... and it probably is?\n\n2) to use the \u201ccalendar function\u201d shown in the preview for the app (the whole reason I downloaded it) you have to make an in-app purchase.

{"body":"Downloaded the app specifically for the time of the full moon. It gave 10:22pm 7\/8\/17. NASA (and everyone else) gives 10:07 (or :06)! Ridiculous! Major Thumbs DOWN \ud83d\udc4e!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"For a free app this is stellar. It gives you what it claims it will and has mini micro transactions for features you probably won't even use. For a free and quick download I'd recommend this. Worst case scenario you just delete it but that won't happen.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This app is so helpful to me. I use this app probably for a reason most don't but it helps me with witchcraft a lot. The moon and it's phases are instrumental to it and so having an app that labels everything so perfectly it's great.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"So, I'm not certain how often it is, but periodically the app will send messages as though they are from the moon and much of what they say tickles me.

{"body":"We use this all the time when we're disagreeing whether the moon's full or not - I've gotten so I can recognize a 98% but not quite full moon","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Paid for this app when it was new, now it wants me to pay a monthly subscription for increased accuracy. Nope. I\u2019ll use a competitor.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This is a great app and pretty accurate as well.\n\nOne nag is that it hides the scores for the events (sunrise, sunset, etc) after the event has taken place. There is no reason to do so, and you may want to see how an event was rated after the fact.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"This is a well organized and well designed app that shows an array of helpful information for the photographer.  However, it makes assumptions that the user would already know how to make the most of its features when it should take the approach of trying to help the user as best it can.\n\nFor example, the joyride explains the sky and light indices however there is no resource for the user to remind themselves of what those features mean outside of the joyride.  Secondarily, the scoring system is not defined\u2014how am I, the user, to interpret a sky index of 8 versus 6, for instance?\n\nFurthermore, its additional features are again not defined.  What is the target on the map? Why is it positioned where it is? Am I to go there for the best possible photo? Best photo according to what metric?\n\nThe developer would also do well to ask themselves how they can best set the user up for success.  What are the definitions of the terms within the app?  How am I, the user, to compare one index to another?  How can I best use the map to my advantage?  What can I look for in the weather integration to maximize my success?\n\nOverall, this app is a well-designed start to a truly useful app.  But to get there it needs to consider the user in addition to just providing data for data\u2019s sake.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I pull this app out most often while in the wilderness, and it doesn't work there because it requires internet. \n\nThis app is basically one large math equation that should be able to run on the iPhone. Even a slightly less accurate \"offline mode\" would be better than it's current broken form.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Just got this and one thing I immediately noticed was a sunrise after 8:30 pm lol. That needs to be changed to sunset. Sunrise is morning! All the details available in this app are awesome!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"It\u2019s almost not usable at all, it doesn\u2019t score right there\u2019s huge black bars of the top in the bottom, it\u2019s super frustrating. Definitely not worth four dollars. If I could get my money back I would.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I haven\u2019t tried the weather portion of the app, but for looking up the golden hour based on location it works fine for me.  I am not a professional photographer, but when I travel I like to use it try to get a better shot than I might have normally.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"This app has proved itself to be very useful. I've lost count of how often I have wasted my time and energy to get to a location to shoot a sunrise or sunset only to be let down by a boring sky. This app won't guarantee you a great shot, but it will greatly improve your odds. I highly recommend. My only question is:  how do you generate revenue, with no IAPs and no ads? \nUpdate: lowering my review. Too many times I\u2019ve left my camera at home because this app said \u201cforget it. Overcast\u201d only to find stunning clouds filling the sky. My window would be a better predictor if there wasn\u2019t a giant tree in front of it.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Beautiful UI. The \"sunset\" and \"light\" index forecasts are very useful and unique. Better ability to juggle multiple locations than other similar apps I've used (mostly they would only give you magic hour times for your current location--useless if you're on the move.) Best app of its category that I've used so far, worth the tiny price.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The reminders have to be set everyday. The app is not programmed to have the reminders automatically remind you everyday, you literally have to log into the app and scroll to each individual day.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"This app has been very helpful in anticipating ideal conditions for shooting. The screens are thoughtfully designed, simple to understand, and fun to use.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I was hesitant to purchase this because I already have PhotoPills. I'm glad I ended up buying. While I still use photopills for golden hour times using the easy to access widget, I now use GoldenHour for easy to read and understand predictions for cloud cover and light quality during golden hour, something photopills lacks. I also find the map tool easier to use in golden hour vs photopills. Well worth the money if you photograph outdoors. Impressive work by the developer. One thing I would like to see in the future is a widget.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The app is great for the purpose of knowing time frames for shooting during the golden or blue hours, but the Weather feature needs more work. I've tested it against my subscription with Skyfire and found significant discrepancies. So far GoldenHour predicted great light and sky on two different sunrises that were both flat wrong. This morning in particular, it predicted sky to be a 10, when in fact the sky barely had any color at all. \n\nThat said, I still believe the app to be useful and hope the developers are able to improve upon its weather feature as the app matures. I know it's possible to get more accurate predictions of sky conditions because SkyFire has proven itself to be a more accurate predictor.  This app is on its way to being a 5 star app, buts it's not there yet. \n\nUser interface is well designed. Expect this app will get even better with time.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app not only tells you when the golden hours occur daily but what you can expect according to local weather conditions. I have found it to be very accurate and extremely useful.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Clock works great. Displaying Blue Hour and Golden Hour is great. The map function and setting locations is fantastic. The weather portion of the app? Not so much. I live in Colorado; more specifically, high sierra landscape and mountain views persist all around. Because of our unique location we get MANY high pressure systems with clouds ranging from trace to copious. Yet, as I marvel at the high cloud accumulation, and dial up the weather portion of this app-it leaves me wondering where they get the info from. I've traveled 3 hours based upon forecasts this app has put out only to be left frustrated. I wanted to trust it and not the weather service or Dark Skies. \n\nNo can do. Been duped by it three times and won't do it again. Missed many opportunities to take some great shots. Went expecting great shots only to be exposed to open skies with no cloud cover. \n\nThe developer sells this based on 100% functionality. All aspects. No can do. Either remove the weather portion or improve it and I'll rewrite the review. \n\nI want this to be my one and only \"go to\" app. \n\nAs of this review, it's one of five frustrating tools I have to use to extrapolate.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Not a bad app. Good idea, nice interface, but the date is wrong. It keeps insisting that the current date is one day behind. I can set the date I want to use, but how could it be so wrong?

{"body":"It's simple, easy to use and it does what it says. I like that it has an explanation golden hour, blue hour and sky indexes (under 'more' category). There are some good features on the bottom of the screen, the 'clock' and 'map' being useful.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is a really great aid for photographers.  There are some that are in the App Store that are far to complex. \n\nThis app is simple and easy to use. \nIt gives the golden hour windows as well as blue hour. \n\nWhat makes it special are the light indexes , weather and the map\n\nThe one thing it lacks or perhaps could not find was the ability to change the map to satellite or hybrid at least as it helps with lighting to known the terrain","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"I have had this app on my Android phone with no problems, I love it and I love Lil Bub. I recently switched to apple and almost immediately downloaded Weather Bub. It is almost perfect. Except the ads are sometimes inappropriate and suggestive in nature. It really takes away from the wholesomeness of the app and it is annoying. I\u2019ve never had this problem with Android. I know it might just be from the ads not having enough info on me to give me targeted ads on my history (as much as I hate that), but I really wish there was some censorship. I don\u2019t want to be checking the weather and looking at the latest Lil Bub pics and scroll down to see girls showing off their butts in the ad. :(","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I\u2019ll be honest; the main reason I downloaded the app was because of BUB. I love cats, and I have my own little rescue kitty that\u2019s currently staring at me. The idea of seeing Lil BUB every time I check the weather was the biggest draw. However - imagine my surprise when I realized how functional it is! Radar, daily weather, detailed percentages: all sorts of data that I didn\u2019t expect the app to contain. Not only that, I could check the weather in different cities too! I decided to buy the option for no ads, and I am pleased with this decision. It\u2019s actually my primary weather app now, and I definitely recommend it. Sometimes the radar acts up\/freezes a little bit, but overall, it\u2019s a great app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Although I do not live in an area that will see an Aurura,  The information this app provides helps me determine when it is safe to go outside.

{"body":"This app is not only severely limited without in-app purchases, even after you pay to unlock the forecast you can't set up alerts without recurring fees. My aurora pro let's you pay upfront and use a real app with notifications or en.vedur.is lets you get the same info on a free site.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"It's an ok app, the problem with this app is the functionality costs extra. If you want alerts, you have to pay extra, if you want long range forecast, it's extra, anything that is expected from this type of app is sold separate. That's annoying.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

The other apps i have just arent reliable in the current and forecasted data. The support that comes from the designer is absolutely amazing!  always there to help!\n\nI only have one suggestion. The app should be a paid app that includes alerts rather than a free app and having to pay for alerts every 6 months.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"I have found Windy to be one of the best weather apps available.  I particularly like the ability to view four different weather models, and to look forward several days with the predictions.  A few suggestions:\n\nIt would be nice if you could see both the selected menu item AND the particular legend.  Currently, after you select a specific item, I.e. rain accumulation, you have to X out of the menu before the ledge down come up at the bottom.  It would be nice if you could see both at the same time and just circulate between menu items.\n\nThe font is pretty small at the bottom...great data, but have a look at the formatting....in some cases things are impossible to read since they are overlapping, such as cloud altitudes.\n\nRain vs. Snow accumulation.......it\u2019s confusing.  Looks to be the same physical accumulation data, but we know inches of snow isn\u2019t inches of water....\n\nWould be nice to be able to zoom the map like all other apps........instead of just having several different fixed scales.\n\nThis is a wonderful app, and I encourage you to keep making it better.

{"body":"This is a fantastic app with lots of information for any weather enthusiast. One thing that I find important, which the old storm app had, was storm tracking and the ability to drill into a cell of the storm and understand hail size, etc... that would be the only improvement that would be nice to see.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Everyone on our island uses Windy during hurricane season. We would be totally unprepared without it.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I enjoy even just watching it. Having several overlays would be nice. Rain and wind speed at the same time. Maybe I\u2019m just not that app talented.  Wonderful app!!!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Yes I am OCD when it comes to deleting history. With this app there really isn\u2019t a easy way. However I did find one, If you delete everything in the \u201cprivacy protection\u201d settings, yes it deletes your history but also makes your searches unusable after that. It breaks the program! Hehe, I noticed it showing errors in the error console. At any rate, this app is stunningly beautiful but still a beta. I am just going to stick with Dark for the time being.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I was a huge fan of Storm from WeatherUnderground and hadn't checked out the other options recently, but when The Weather Channel killed Storm and replaced it with a mediocre weather channel version I had a look at the other options and was very happy to find Windy. It's so much much better than the others, let me count (a few of) the ways: You can pick your forecast model! And then compare the different models to see where they differ! That to me is a game changer. The timeline along the bottom is so great to see how pressure and fronts will move - I feel like I've learned a lot just by using the app. The many layer options are great - set it for what you want to see and don't be distracted by what you don't. And of course the wind animation options make for a visually appealing interface. Seeing how the different altitude winds are moving and changing is so useful and interesting. I'd gladly pay money for this app, there are just so many great things to say about it. And if all you want is a sun, a cloud, or an umbrella for where you live that's there for you too. I was bummed when Storm was killed off but am so happy to have found this great app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I love the app, great job! However, I\u2019m not familiar with changing the temperature scale from Celsius to Fahrenheit ... please improve.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"As I pilot in Honduras I find the app helpful in my preflight planning. Thank you for making it available","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I think I would enjoy this app if I could figure out how to get it out of Celsius in into Fahrenheit. If you have any suggestions let me know","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Want to see clouds coverage, rain, lightning, and thunderstorms all at once like other radar apps then download those because you don\u2019t get that with this app. I had it for 5 minutes to view Hurricane Florence AND the weather in my location, but could only see one at a time. Also, the settings wouldn\u2019t stay.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I like this app, a lot, but ... all my temps show as C rather than F, which is what the settings have been set to. I\u2019d give it five stars, otherwise.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"Since the Weather Channel ruined the Storm app, I turned to Windy to get the wind animation and multi-city forecasts that I was accustomed to. Windy provides all that I seek in a weather app, and more. It did take time to find things, and my iPad version still will only show 3 overlay options, but lots of other display choices I do not care about and did not select in the same column of choices. Once I (accidentally) found the meteograms I am fascinated, but wish there was some place to learn what the detailed meaning. I also wish that front symbols would be able to display with temperatures, wind, or rain. I find the thunderstorm info distracting and wish I could turn it off.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Used this app on a boat delivery from Seattle to San Diego. I was amazed how accurate the wind and wave predictions were. A great tool in the go, no go decision making process.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Beautiful, full featured, stable, and goes above & beyond in information and models - all while being free. \n\nSeriously, what more could you ask for.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Best weather app for travel via boating, small aircraft or hiking.   I do it all and check this almost daily.  The only downfall is Mother Nature herself.  No complaints here, plus I had all my family,  friends and acquaintances check out this app for download on their smartphone.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Hello. I enjoy the App but what did it from being my all the time go to weather app is that it lacks an Apple watch app and viewing the forecast and current conditions can be overwhelming at times. This is coming from a weather nerd and someone who provided weather observation and forecasts for the Navy. You are almost there tho. Please consider these updates ideas.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"I live in Eastern Thailand, this app has been extremely accurate for me, using almost daily for 2 years.

{"body":"This is a wonderful apps where else could you find the model coverage, upper air data and forecast which is unbelievably up to date, modern and useful. It\u2019s more of a scientific site and not for the everyday user unless you have some basic map weather map training","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"As a student pilot, knowing current weather conditions is very important in determining if the day is suitable for flight training. I will likely continue to use this along with other weather resources as a piloting tool because of the the amount of data and the accuracy of data it provides. It\u2019s also more intuitive than other weather resources such as the Aviation Weather Center provided by the NWS in understand the \u201cbig picture\u201d of weather patterns. I realize the information provided by Windy.com is available, elsewhere, but having it all in one place makes accessing it faster and easier. This is truly a remarkable app that I hope continues into the future. Thank you to the developers of this great website and app!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I am a full time cruiser from Canada to FL keys.  As such accurate wind and wave forecasts are critically important to me. Have used many weather apps but Windy.com is my go to App because it is consistently the most accurate and easiest to use. All the information I need with multiple forecast models in one app!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Please fix the airgram issue.  Has been a known issue for a long time and it hasn\u2019t been resolved. Developer is slow to fix things. Still the best weather app for predicting wind forecasts that I have used.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I\u2019m a nerd who reads reviews.  I am very impressed with the developer\u2019s consistent responses in the few cases where people had issues.  As a business owner, I appreciate how difficult it can be sometimes.  Kudos to the developers.\n\nAs for the actual App, it\u2019s really awesome.  My husband is a pilot, we go boating in the bay and farther out for Grouper fishing.  This App never disappoints.\n\nIt\u2019s also fun to look at, which is a plus!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This a really good app but it fails to offer an offline mode. There are numerous requests for this feature but no positive response from the developer. \n\nI am not sure why but i know there is no technical reason it can\u2019t be done. Whether your a sailor, hiker, or camper you are not always connected but good weather predictions are always critical.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I really like the \u201cfuturecast\u201d option which seems rare among weather apps. Other unique and useful features are the roadside camera links, snow depth maps, fog maps, and ocean info.  I work outdoors much so I am always looking for a good weather app. This one is one of the best, if not the best. For suggested improvements, I wish there was an option for entering a list of reference locations for quick access to weather forecasts at those sites (this is common on most other weather apps). Movement of the location pin is a little odd as the pin remains stationary, but you move the map to change locations.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"There are times when this app has the pilots I fly with thinking I graduated with a meteorology major and it seems like every time it\u2019s modified for improvement someone plain read my mind . Check it out .","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"Sailor, hiker, traveler, outside worker: all roles I do in life, and all enhanced through the use of Windy. Works all over the planet. Reliably accurate forecasting. Constantly enhanced and upgraded. If you monitor weather for work, pleasure, or both and more, get this app!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is the best! Forecast are quite reliable. I sail the California coast and local islands. Use it more than any other app I have and there are several. It\u2019s so nice to see the whole world and it associated patterns. Great job and please, please, don\u2019t sell out to The Weather Channel.

{"body":"As a pilot, weather information is critical and understanding trends and the big picture is invaluable. This app provides fantastic visibility from the micro to the macro and looks amazing doing it. I use it almost daily and rely heavily on the information it provides to help me better understand what the weather is doing and where it might be going.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Very reliable and dependable.  Did I mention that it is very versatile.  So many different option to be able to use and look at.  I use it to look at winds aloft at different altitudes.

{"body":"This app is wonderful for planning and for knowing what\u2019s going on outside. The various layers are super-helpful for Flight planning as well. The simple and intuitive interface is very user friendly. I like that one can get as detailed as they want, with meteograms, etc.\n\nBefore it was changed, I used to use the Storm app as a supplement, because it showed surface prog charts and storm tracks. Those would be two layers that this app could benefit from ASAP. The other Change I would make would be to be able to place several layers on at once (cloud base and CAPE, for example).","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I really wanted to like this app.  It offers so, so much in terms of data sources, displays, predictions, and potential usefulness.  Unfortunately the app design does not provide adequate tools for users to choose and manage these options.  Every data option is excessively detailed, simple choices, like F or C temp. display, cannot be saved even though the SAVE button is pressed.  Display options for temp. gradients are inconsistent.  Labels for features like the speed of radar animation are barely visible on an iPad and nearly invisible on iPhone.  This app offers so much potential.  It could have been great.  Instead it comes across as a mess of sources that were combined with little thought about function and user experience.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Best app out there for a visual depiction of the weather in whichever way you want to see it. Currently ad-free and with a very well designed interface. One request: This app would be 11\/10 if you could add a clouds layer on top of the temperature layer.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Here on the windy West Coast I have to know what's going on with the weather and Windy never lets me down. You won't believe the precise detail and beautiful graphics of this app until you see it for yourself.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I run a charter operation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico and fish over 200 days a year. I have been using windy for 3 years now and it is the most accurate weather forecasting I have ever used. The hourly forecast is one of the best features. I can plan my day behind windy. I highly recomend it","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I don\u2019t write a lot of reviews, but this app is so cool I had to do one. The amount of information is amazing, and even better is the way it is implemented. The alert feature is especially innovative and useful. Just get it!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The app is great \n\n however the colours overlaid on map make no sense , eg I want to know where it is going to snow and the colours range from blue to red , how can that be useful for snow ?\n\n Most weather forecasts I see for snow show white for snow and blue for rain","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"With an entirely new and vital approach to understanding winds, clouds and weather phenomena, Windy is my go to screen whenever I need to refresh my mind and tune out all the noise surrounding me on social media. It\u2019s actually therapeutic to watch the soothing paths of wind over the Earth\u2019s surface!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Air grams and meteograms crash the app. You cannot set an account picture. Those features are broken. Otherwise it is a fantastic app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Latest iOS 11.3 breaks Windy\u2019s Airgram mode, screen scrolls up, like the airgram window is opening and closing.  Have to kill app to stop it.  Posting this here because there is apparently no other way to contact support.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Update: Now I'm getting harassing emails from the developer to change the review. \n\nTo use the app fully, apparently, logging in with email address and password is required. That is definitely not happening. App removed.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"We live on an outer island in the San Juan Islands of Washington state. The only way on and off our island is with a boat or a float plane. Knowing  what the weather and winds are going to do is essential to our safety and the safety of our boats. We have found that Windy is the most reliable and consistently correct weather app we have used so far. We downloaded it in September, it is now March, and only once was Windy incorrect. ONLY ONCE! Pretty darned good! Windy, keep up the good work! You are keeping us safe and happy!!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is one of the best weather apps with regards to the accuracy of its forecasts.\nHowever, to me, the app design is a bit frustrating: why can't it remember my previous view and instead always defaults to something I am not interested in. Also, it seems absurd that the favorite locations can only be displayed on the map at the expense of some weather data.\nFinally, I do not understand why, when opening the app, the map centers on a location that is neither my current position (location is on) or one of my saved locations...\nThose minor gripes seem pretty easy to address, and when they are this app will be perfect.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I originally gave this app a review of 1 star due to the latest software update, which made the forecasting tool way off as far as temperatures in my area. Since the review not only has it improved but Apple contacted me to see if it had changed and offered assistance in any fixes! Now that\u2019s standing behind your product, another reason why my household is APPLE!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Nice app, but the settings are glitchy. Registered as a user to save settings and yet, the units still default to metric.\n\nUPDATE 3.8.18: unfortunately, the setting glitch still appears to be happening. No matter how many times I set the temp unit to Fahrenheit, it defaults to Centigrade when using the \u2018advanced settings\u2019. Also, time format selection doesn\u2019t work.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"if only i could.  best weather app, paid or free, ever made, end of story, end of discussion, I am right, period.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Weather apps are like opinions, everyone has one. In the case of Windy, I don't need any of the other paid or free weather applications, this has it all. Excellent design and operation for such a small storage footprint. Smooth radar, great map design.  Everything one needs to know about wind from a novice to pro, including isolines and wind barbs (called airgrams in the app) that are not found in other popular apps  No text forecast predictions like all the others that are just that, always inaccurate. Its easy to predict your own weather with Windy, as all the tools are there. Want to know your own accurate forecast for the weekend? Screenshot to your camera roll the aspect you want to know, wind, temps, sun, clouds etc... early in the week, take a screenshot every day or every other day, and watch the trend, by Friday you will have a fairly accurate idea of what your weekend will be like. Kudos to the developers and code team for a well designed and smooth operating weather app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"As a commercially rated pilot, I highly recommend this app. I use this app on a daily basis to keep myself and my passengers safe!\n\nEdit: \n\nMultiple months later.. loving the updates!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Amazing, Dependable, ect. any good word you could use double it! This app it VERY dependable! I live in the United States and not in Europe. I thought that it could be a stretch with getting a European Weather app when I live in the US but when they pretty much nailed the paths of hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate I new it was time to switch. I had a problem I had no clue which on to get. Some friends from Indian who visited recommended this. It took about 5 minuets to figure out but once you do it is SO easy to use and so accurate I have used this in past winter storms of what to expect and I was more prepared than the rest of my family who was depending on the National Weather Service!  \n\nThank you so so much Windy Crew!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is amazing...I love the time lapse for all the components....wind, temp, clouds, rain...it\u2019s all there and simple to use. So far I feel it is very accurate...you can get all the weather information you need in seconds.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great app but the display isn\u2019t responsive and doesn\u2019t scale up on the iPhone X. Have not tried app on iPad yet.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I have a habit of leaving my location off most of the time to save battery. I noticed when I press the home button it would show me the location and weather of Suffolk county instead of where I am actually located. Not much of an issue if I just turned my location service on but it would be nice to press the button and see the weather update for my area without my location activated.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Maybe I have not figured out how to configure the app but snow and Ice forecasts are only in centimeters and cannot be converted to inches. Rain does have the option to be shown either way in the metograms.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The latest update has hidden the altitude slider & made it less convenient to use. Yes, it's still there. But it must be opened each time to use it. Whereas it was right on the main screen in the past, making quick adjustments for comparison very quick & easy. For this less than ideal decision, I've snagged 1 star. But for remaining an awesome FREE app, albeit this little blunder, you get to keep the other 4 stars. How about correcting that tiny error in judgement so I can give you your other star back as I really have no use for it.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Living in the Caribbean, we rely a lot on weather for work and fun such as to go boating, fishing, surfing, etc. I\u2019ve downloaded pretty much every app you can think of and nothing beats Windy. \n\nAdditionally, it was a great help for this year\u2019s hurricane season. \n\nI just have one request: iPhone X support!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great app, used for the most part through hurricane Irma and for hurricane Maria just before the cellphone reception and energy source where gone here in Puerto Rico.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I just started using this app. What a find! So much information at your fingertips. I love it.\nThank you developer.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I love the app and have found it particularly useful in monitoring SO2 content of the air during the recent fires in Northern California. My caveat is that the 12.30 upgrade makes it a lot slower on an older device (IPod 5th Gen). I found the upgrade prettier but degraded in performance.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Been looking for weather apps for a while and saw some other app using a source called \"Windy\" for their radar data so I thought I would check it out. Low and behold Windy turned out to be the weather app of my dreams! So easy to use and so much visual and statistical data at my fingertips. And with the new visual update, things feel sleeker and look more appealing than ever with no features being compromised!\n\nFor those looking for a no-nonsense and complete weather app, just stop looking and download this! Its premium quality for no cost.\n\nGreat work on this great app! I hope to use it for a long time to come :)\n\nMy feedback for the developer would be to keep it optimized and keep the interface clean and to the point. I have old hardware (iPhone 5s) and it would kill it for me if it stopes being as smooth as it is now to pop open and read\/see the weather.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This shows just about everything that an amateur weather buff would like.  It's not as localized as other apps but this gives a greater picture overall.  The only fault I have found is the forecast temperature for my area, So Cal, are lower than reality.  It was 105\u00b0 today and the forecast was 99\u00b0.  Other than that it's still my favorite weather app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I love this app! I have used many other ones, this one is easy and  intuitive. If you are into Boating, kitesurfing or just want a easy way to get an idea of what the wind and the weather will be for the next few days this works.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is a great app and an excellent reference. I don't understand and the negativity.  If you are relying on a iPhone app to give you critical make-or-break marine weather decisions then you probably don't belong offshore. If you use this app as a single component in a well thought out approach to weather forecasting then you're going to love it.

According to the app it's going to be 300\u00b0 F in Savannah during the hurricane (winds at a modest 42 mph).  \n\nI wish they would show what run of the model.

{"body":"I downloaded Windy.tv and was pretty excited about having a reliable weather forecast app. I will say that it is more accurate than my preinstalled iPhone Weather App and has upheld my expectations for reliable  weather information. I don't know where the problem lays, but even with a thorough instruction from a \"Moderator\"  to personalize colors and layers and other such things, my windy.tv just simply does not add up to par. The \"Moderator\" I spoke to was very patient and helpful. Laid out simple instructions on how to navigate the menus to reach the destination to perform said actions, complete with pictures and the whole 9 yards, however, my settings menu and whatnot did NOT display the same options as the pictures he provided for my reference. And when he talked me through figuring out how to send a screen shot of my \"Settings\" menu to provide proof of the differences between our apps, upon selecting to choose a photo from my \"photo library\" the app instantly closed out and restarted the app. This has happened EVERY time I have selected this option. EVEN to change my \"profile picture\". Also various quantities on the map have very similar colors to opposite extremes. And example would be a deep blue for no wind and also a deep blue for heavy wind. Or a magenta for extreme hot temperature and a similar purple for extreme cold temperatures and such. I give this app a 2 star rating because it does provide a more reliable weather forecast for very many aspects of various lifestyles, however customizing it to your own needs and wants has been a huge challenge for me.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

Very small icons to select from(wind-pressure) all clustered together , almost impossible to select and change elevations on the left side of the screen. The the update was supposed to improve functionality on iPad like devises, but if it does it comes at the expense of the iPhone. Another common example of not leaving well enough alone. Hopefully a future update will address this, I'm keeping my fingers crossed.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"This comes so close to being the ultimate weather app for me. I originally got it to compare with other wind monitoring apps but discovered, to my great delight, that its \"detailed forcast\" feature makes it better than all my other weather apps too, including Weather Bug. \n\nHowever, I wish there was a way to show the detailed forecast ALL of the time or at least provide a way to access it. The only way it shows up is when the app first launches. Which means it must be force quit in order to refresh that forecast next time it's opened. And sometimes, even that doesn't work! But oh, if that gets fixed this will be THE ultimate weather app for me! \n\nIt would also be nice to have more contrast on the map. It's hard to see the names and borders of states.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Wonderful!!! Love it. It's slick and informative and I could stare at it for hours. Such a user friendly intuitive touch interface!! Particularly love that you can see the traditional forecast format with just a touch as well- no need for a second app. Only improvement I'd like to see: I love the current function on the website and would like to see that go mobile.

{"body":"Ive never left a rating or comment on an app before and am only doing so because this one is so deserving. Like my title says, this is truly the best and most accurate weather app available. I use to check the doppler radar sites for my weather bc the stock apps on my phone are literally worthless. Then I found the windytv website through a user on Reddit and never looked back.

Hey I do have one question... can you add the ability to display Dust Extinction to the overlays? \nTHe search for location on the APP and the link up to OBS is great as is the forecast display.\n\nI use an IPH5 ... I suppose I will have to get use to the touchy feely parts. Trying to zoom or do other things and get different results due to the touch to display items that change levels and overlays. But a small price to pay... this is a great app!\nThanks!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

It would be nice to get rid of silly things like \u201cH2 Oh-no!\u201d if wanted, like an option to turn it off while getting the same information. Only other thing is that the weather accuracy is different than that of the Weather Channel that the base iPhone weather app tells me. Which, it isn\u2019t a big difference, so it\u2019s not a big deal, just a little off putting, even though I have no idea which one is actually accurate haha. I do know that Dark Sky Weather is accurate  and popular, but I think having it match with what the phone says would be helpful. Otherwise very wonderful!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

I went from a 7 Plus to an SE and now the today widget is useless and I have to expand all notifications to see what to wear.

{"body":"When I first got this app I didn't think much of it. It was clean and sleek. Very pleasing. Not too crowded. I thought it was interesting how it customs to my weather tolerance. What I think makes this app unique is it sends me weather notifications of what it was going to be like throughout the day with a recommendation on what to wear. The recommendations are based on what clothing items you input which i didn't really take the time to do. So I turned off the clothing suggestions and I just had it send me the weather for the day only. I must say this weather notification thing is weirdly addicting. Not like in the sense where it gets your adrenaline pumping but I found myself reading the daily weather every morning. Once my free trial was over it felt weird not receiving a notification. I had to get the notification feature. Overall great app. No ad bs on the user experience which is a great plus. The basic version without notifications is still nice. Would definitely recommend to those who base their day on the daily weather. Before this I didn't care what the weather would be and would almost always be blindsided when bipolar weather hit, freezing one day blazing hot the next. Nifty simple app","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

The app has the information, why can\u2019t it just display that on the watch??\n\nIn my job, working around explosives is important to know when lightning is actively around and in Florida that\u2019s often.  But I can\u2019t pull out my phone every time I get a watch notification.\n\nMake the Apple Watch side more functional and this would be a 5 Star app, especially in my line of work.\n\nUPDATE!\n\nNow the app is very useful, and gives me distances of lightning from my last known location to my notifications and my Apple Watch.

{"body":"This app is very helpful but I have some tips that I would love to see in later updates. When the lightning strikes and it alerts you, it would be nice for the alert to say how far away the lightning was. For example: Lightning strike 6.7 miles from your location. That would be better than having to open the app to see where it struck. Also I would like to see an option of it alerting you once every minute that lightning strikes in the area instead of it alerting you once every 10 minutes. If this option was to be enabled, that is when it would be helpful for the exact location to be alerted through notifications. That is all the tips I got, I still love the app but I think this would make it better. Thank you","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}

WA very seldom receives updates, and this dev shop has a history of dropping support for apps, after a short period of time. \n\nOn my iPhone X, the ads really clutter up the UI and make it impossible to fully evaluate this app objectively. They are such an eyesore.\n\nHello Weather and Carrot Weather are both far better apps that also receive regular updates and feature upgrades.\n\nUpdate: When this app was initially released, I was reticent to download it bc I remember this same dev shop abandoning a previous weather app only 12-18 months after release. My skepticism was well founded, as it took 4 months for them to respond to my feedback. Furthermore, this app hasn\u2019t been updated in over 7 months.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Sunday\u2019s forecast in the app is for light snow, 2 inches. Why does the weather alert then list a major blizzard capable of producing 15-22 inches of snow? Luckily precipitation totals are hard to find. Coincidence?","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I check the weather on my phone a lot more often now. Weather Up is simply a delight to use. So carefully considered in every facet of interaction. \nI do kind of miss the Dark Sky-style \"will it rain in the next hour\" hyper-local forecasting, and it would be nice if locations synced across devices, but those small nits should in no way discourage you from trying this app. Once you do that, my guess is that you'll want to buy a subscription.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Super hyped about the possibilities of this app.  I paid for the ad free version so I could see my appointments and the weather together. Needless to say I have yet to see one local appointment synced with my iPhone Calendar. I wasted my money and $10 for an app is ridiculous. I\u2019m very let down","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"UPDATE 12-2-18:\nThis app now has a new name and a couple improvements, but the rest of the disappointments remain. First, the good\u2026 \n\nThe radar does now load faster and the new calendar-based weather feature is very clever. Unfortunately, that's it for improvements. \n\nAll the other disappointments mentioned below remain\u2014and now come with a subscription price that is double before\u2026\n\nThe watches and warnings are still using the same, non-standard colors. Only one set of watch\/warnings are allowed at a time, so you can't have both a winter storm AND thunderstorm layer on at the same time. Tapping a watch\/warning area still provides no info about it, such as its expiration time. The iPad UI annoyance mentioned below is less of an issue because the location panel now auto-collapses, but that also means more tapping to re-open it to see other locations or events, so that's kind of a wash.\n\nUltimately, it's basically the same app with a new name. One step forward thanks to the new calendar integration, but one step backwards with the subscription price after so much time and so little progress. Therefore, my original rating of 3 stars, sadly, still stands. \n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nWeather Atlas is good but not great, and coming from this generally outstanding developer, that\u2019s a bit of a disappointment. It\u2019s undoubtedly the prettiest radar-centric weather app in the App Store, but that\u2019s about where the greatness ends.\n\nRadar data is very slow to load. Sometimes, especially on the iPhone, precipitation overlays slightly off from the map, making rain look closer\/farther away than it is. The app still uses non-standard color-coding for watches and warnings, and it\u2019s frustrating that only one watch\/warning layer is allowed at a time, making some of the more useful layers mutually exclusive.\n\nWhile the minimal UI is greatly appreciated, I wish on the iPad I could move the forecast panel to the lower right corner instead of its permanent home in the lower left \u2013 after all, most weather comes out of the west, so this panel often covers up the weather coming in, whereas I care less about the weather that\u2019s already passed to the east, so covering that instead would be better. \n\nMy final criticism with this app has to do with the subscription. Unlike many, I don\u2019t mind paying to support this app. $5\/year is not much \u2013 if the app were great and if it were updated frequently. Unfortunately, neither is the case. Developers argue they need a subscription to constantly roll out updates, but this app is not updated terribly often and the flaws I listed above have remained since day one. \n\nI want to love this app, and it\u2019s not far from being great. I hope in the coming months, they\u2019ll put some love into the UI\/UX to take it to the next level.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I am a weather app junkie. My folder of weather apps on my phone is overflowing. My favorite is hello weather which I happily subscribe too for $4.99. But hello doesn\u2019t have feels like temps in the hourly forecast. I still subscribed minus a feels like in futures hours. Weather up shows that data which so why I was so excited when I stumbled on this app. I do a lot outside so it\u2019s critical I can see the \u201cfeels like\u201d temp 3 hours or so from now. At first I was ready to subscribe to weather up until it was time to get the dogs outside at 9p. Weather up said the feels like temp was 16. So I bundled up ready to brave the cold. Much to my surprise it wasn't cold at all. I opened another weather app and the swing was a wild 20 degrees higher. As much as I cringe at the $9.99 annual fee (rather high for a minimalist weather app) this app needs to have other weather providers to choose from (like hello weather). If they do I\u2019d be inclined to subscribe. Though $5.00 is more where I see this app but I\u2019m an old\nMan that still doesn\u2019t get the whole subscribe stuff.

What the app essentially does us show your meetings\/events in the app. However, integration should mean that for my meetings that have a location, it shows the weather in that location. Of course, it doesn\u2019t seem like the app can do that. Reached out to the dev to make sure I\u2019m not doing it wrong but so far I have yet to hear back.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

Current and future radar are all that matter in a weather app...no one cares about where the rain was an hour ago. The developer says that as soon as this feature is available from their information provider, they will add it to Weather Atlas. That\u2019s all anyone can ask for.\n\nImpressively, Weather Atlas opens and immediately shows the two most important things to me, the local map at the top and the hourly forecast at the bottom. And from there it's only one tap to any other place you want to go. \n\nAlso, even in the ad-supported version, Weather Atlas doesn't make you scroll through a bunch of weather-related pictures and videos to finally see the radar and other components (like The Weather Channel does, even for their paid subscription). \n\nGreat start to what I think will evolve into a really great weather app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

Most annoyingly, I still have no idea what API this app uses. And that's frustrating. That info should be clear. And if it's a custom algorithm, it can say that. I live in an area where the differences between Wunderground and Dark Sky are significant and I have no clue whether to trust or utterly dismiss the forecast.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I don't have a way to contact you from the app to leave some feedback. Please add that. \nApp defaults to LA for forecast when I already allowed location services, and my location is shown on the map.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"So far I've used it and it's been easy, it's been accurate so far and has features that some weather apps don't have. I strongly recommend people getting this","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"More than happy to pay for good work from devs. But this is getting out of control. This is a weather app. Which is great. Would love to pay you for it. But not every year. \n\nOtherwise, a good app for checking the weather. I think the interface could use some simplification- the map settings and options are in different places. The data seems to pull from reliable sources.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I really like the design of this app, but the widgets could be better. As janky as Dark Sky is in a lot of areas, its widget is excellent. It shows current conditions, rainfall, and upcoming day forecasts without being cramped. Less cramped widgets, Forecast.io data, and Dark Sky-style rain alerts would make me a very happy subscriber.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"I know this app brand new, but so far this looks like a very cool app. It does everything I want in a weather app, and is very clean and simple. None of the other weather apps check all of the boxes, in my opinion.  I paid the $5 annual fee and don't regret it.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Everything is well laid out, from weather information all the way down to the ads. So well laid out that I'm willing to pay support to the app and remove the pesky things. Sadly, no matter on what process I try this app will not let me upgrade to Pro. I will look forward to a bug release soon.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Solid meh. It looks like they tried to match the bottom sliding panel but the implementation\nis lacking. It shows me the weather but usability is not there. Ads are where I want to try and dismiss the panel. Also, really!? a subscription for ad removal?","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app helps me stay ahead of the pricing swings that occur with the ever-changing weather conditions in the growing regions for my key commodities. I used to use several different apps to accomplish what this one app can do. Score! One step ahead of my competition.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Downloaded onto both iPad air and iPhone 6 app crashes. No way to buy a subscription which is required to use this app. Go to the web site and there is a description of pricing but now way to enter information and subscribe. Would think the developer would at least allow a short period for preview like a week or at least a couple of days. Great potential here but the installation portion of this experiance did not go well.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I\u2019ve always loved Today Weather on both iOS and Android, but weather alert details really need to be pulled into the app. In a world where most everyone wants to accomplish more with fewer clicks, having the app spawn Safari to view the alert, seems unnecessary. Even just a summary would be great. As it is now though, I can choose \u201cOK\u201d or \u201cDetails\u201d. Otherwise, it\u2019s a great app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"This is the only app I\u2019ve found in dozens of weather apps to combine beauty and information. Most apps are beautifully simple which means they either lack information or take swipes and clicks to get to what you need. Others have too much or are too busy to give you the overview you need. This app has all the information in a simple screen that makes it all quick to view, including radar.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Maybe I\u2019m missing something but app says air quality is good when we have total smoke from Camp Fire.  Cannot recommend given this even tho it is beautiful.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"With the exception of the radar, this is a relatively good weather app. The radar, however, is the worst I\u2019ve seen. It is the opposite of smooth and the blotchy, hit-or-miss presentation makes the radar all but useless. Hard to recommend this app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I'm a weather nerd. I've used all the weather apps and I'm partial to apps that take advantage of forecast.io (i.e) Dark Sky) data. I am not a fan of Dark Sky's layout nor how it presents its data. So far, this app is perfect for me. Love the minimal look, the days that's available and the developer was smart to include multiple sources.  Clearly there is serious thought being put into design.  I gladly gave this developer my money. Highly recommended. \n\nHaving said that, I am hopeful for an Apple Watch component. I have to keep Dark Sky around for now, as I have that as a complication on my watch home screen.  If this gets Apple Watch support, I'm dumping Dark Sky!\n\nKeep up the great work and continue to iterate on this great design. \n\nOne other note:  someone else stated because it has a dark background, that it saved battery life. With the current LCD displays I don't think that's true. OLED would save battery though as pixels are truly unlit with OLED.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I used to use TheWeatherChannels app but they\u2019ve made it so cluttered with ads and useless information that it\u2019s hard to even find where they display the weather. This app is so much simpler to read and navigate compared to TWC","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"What happened to this app? Forecasts lack detail now. Extremely annoying. Just put all the info in there.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I have very few complaints, the app has a beautiful amoled black colour, and pleasant images, but on the iPhone X the time in the top left is cut off and looks bad.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Paid for this app after viewing all the cool features on a android phone. Map overlays (like wind direction) available to android uses do not exist for iPhone users. The other features are good but I can get this data from other sites.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The developer refuses to remove the photo credit from our own photos. This is very annoying. I don't want someone else's photo credit on my own photo! Fix that and it's 5 stars.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Good layout with a lot of info. Only thing they need to work on is the radar. For one there is no current location pin, there is plenty of room for richer features.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Would be 5 star without the ads., in app purchase to remove adds a pricey $3.99 expensive app!  Wait for it, those who buy the removal of ads, will likely get in-App subscription charges for new features, Apple Watch complications! lol, The ads ruin this app... All about monetization! \nAlso the developer programmed any cities ahead of international dateline i.e. Australia, show \u201cthe next 7 days weather\u201d still including the day before, like on Monday night, they still see Sunday\u2019s high\/low temperature bar!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Best Weather App so far but i wish to add Black(Dark) widget, And on widget to add animations like on inside the App...","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is perfect to me. I love the look and feel of it and it\u2019s an app I can beautifully share the weather with family and friends across the world. There\u2019s one small but huge thing from keeping me from giving it 5 stars. Maybe something on a future update... My way of saying it\u2019s possible, I beg you. To please give us the option of adding our own photos. While still keeping the text matching an accent color in the photos the way you have it now. It\u2019s so appealing to the eye because of that. But this option would be a great way for us to share the weather. And the app in the process. Thanks!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Great app and design. Nice widget. Little slow loading on the widget...nothing major.  Very clear that a lot of hard work went into this app. Thank you!\n\nOne issue:\n\n1) Not fixed - Radar animation is very choppy for the United States.\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1) Allow ability to reorder sections","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I love the all black theme, great for the new screen on the X. Also love the font, layout, sources, and ease of use.  \n\nPhotos could use improvement by displaying scenes more relevant to your actual location (which it already uses). Im in the Midwest and was given a photo of the Rockies. Type in NYC and you\u2019ll get anything, but not New York.\nIt\u2019s a bummer too, because without the photos, they layout becomes very cluttered.\n\nOnce the photos situation is improved, it can become a home-screen app.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I would give a higher rating if I could turn off Amber Alerts considering the fact I paid for the App.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Absolutely stunning weather app! The design is so beautiful and sleek plus it provides so much information you didn\u2019t even know you needed!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is a great free weather app. It gives you a lot of information for free and has a beautiful design. My biggest gripe which caused me to take off 2 stars was the load info times. For some reason this weather app takes forever to load compared to all the others I\u2019ve used. The stock weather app loads almost instantly while this app consistently takes a full 10 seconds to load the current weather. If it weren\u2019t for that, this app would be an easy 5 stars.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I know...we Homesnap are never satisfied, however since you asked...Horizontal format option maybe? And the option to reposition things that are important to us? That should give you something to work on. Thanks.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Love this app. Very nice design, the black looks really nice on the iPhone X\nThe option to choose the weather data provider is awesome. \nWould like to see a light option for the radar though. Makes it easier to see the rain \/ snow.\nCan\u2019t say I\u2019m a fan of the icon... but it\u2019s not a deal breaker. \nOne option I\u2019d like to see is the ability to set as \u201calways\u201d in the background settings. I don\u2019t mind a little battery usage to keep the app current to my location.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I love the app but would like to see the wallpapers reflect the type of weather it is. For example, if it\u2019s 20 degrees I don\u2019t want to see a picture of a daisy flower. It should be like winter pictures. I hope if they update that this gets implemented.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Use another weather app like the stock one that works better than this one. One would expect the newest device like the iPhone X to have smooth scrolling in a simple weather app but this is not the case here. The app looks good but the lagginess is unbearable...","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The design and the true black background make this the best looking weather app in the iPhone X. \n\nThat\u2019s where the good news ends.\n\nDespite paying for the premium membership the app is almost useless:\n- incorrect forecasts compared to other apps (this app has said clear and mid 30s \u00b0F when other apps correctly said single digits and snow)\n- phases of the moon that often are each one day apart (new moon yesterday, full moon tomorrow?)\n- radar can not play the time lapse\n- 3 ways to see the upcoming conditions; one allows you to swipe backwards, the other two require you change your hand position and stretch for a \u201cback\u201d button\n\nI contacted the developer weeks ago and never heard back.\n\nI\u2019m personally insulted by the author asking for 5 star ratings in order to stay inspired to keep improving this app. Seriously? If all you want is stars then why did I pay $3?\n\nI will be asking for a refund from the App Store.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"It truly is magnificent. There are some things that would make it better, but even right now it is grand. Without premium, there are on-page strip ads, so no pop ups or anything and you can\u2019t use the radar. With how much this app offers, I thought it was worth it to get the full lifetime license. It\u2019s like $4.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I've had the app for about two weeks and my only real crucial complaint is that the radar is broken. Watching it play doesn't have any animation, it just shows frames appearing then disappearing and you can't tell at all what's happening or where the storm will go. Everything else I love, especially the all black design that's super easy on the eyes. Wish I could give all 5 but this issue with the radar is big.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app has everything you could need in a weather app and looks amazing on the iPhone X\u2019s OLED screen. It\u2019s by far the best-looking weather app available... EXCEPT for the ugly adds that stand out like a sore thumb and completely ruin the otherwise perfect UI. This is why I decided to purchase the Ad-Free upgrade. After purchasing the $3.99 lifetime \u2018subscription\u2019 the advertisements were still there. Trying the option to \u2018Restore Purchase\u2019 causes the app to hang. Uninstalling and reinstalling the app had no effect and the developer\u2019s website won\u2019t even load - do yourself a favor and just use the free version.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app is great for someone who wants something different with a little more info than the regular iPhone weather app. I use it all the time and it refreshes very fast.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I have many weather apps on my phone. Each does something different than the others so I keep them around. That is until this app. Wow is it amazing. Gives me all the details I want (UV, pollution, etc) and looks good to boot. \n\nAfter installing I've actually scaled back the number of apps & likely will continue to do so.  \n\nDefinitely worth a download and I love the morning forecast on lock screen","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Like many reviewers on here, I LOVE weather apps. When a new one comes out, I just have to download. But that soon may stop. I love this app and the layout. I did not give it 5 stars because of the lousy radar. I paid for this app for no ads and the radar. It is very disappointing and sub-par. I must keep my NOAA radar app to get the much-needed instant cloud coverage information being I work  often outside and heavily rely on accurate and timely radar images for up-to-the-second information. Please fix this and make this feature just as gorgeous as the rest of the app.....especially if one is paying for it!!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I love this app! The dark design is great, especially on the X\u2019s screen. However, the app icon makes no sense. It's not pretty like the app and doesn\u2019t have anything to do with weather. Please change it.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Great app finally found a replacement for the default app. I would like to see Apple Watch support and a more compressed main page. Having to scroll to see all the info is a bit much. Maybe have it as an option.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I must have tried and purchased 30 weather apps, this is one of the best I've used. Just one suggestion, the font on app and widget could be just a little bit larger.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"To be honest, I\u2019m not really into the dark design. I actually really like how the iPhone\u2019s stock Weather app looks on the iPhone X. And this app blacks out the bottom of the screen. WHY?!! Why waste screen space. Fill it! I paid dearly for this screen real estate.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This is the first app I\u2019ve used that was designed head to toe for iPhone X, taking full advantage of the true blacks of the OLED and the all screen display. I still use Dark Sky for notifications, but since this one uses the Dark Sky Data, I\u2019m a huge fan. And it can only get better.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Every other weather app offers a radar view for free so why would I pay for it on this app? Other than that a very nice looking app. Would also like to see photos from my area, not from random locations.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Not a bad weather app. It has become my go-to homepage weather app which is saying something. I do have a couple of suggestions to make it juuuuuuust right:\n\n- I like line graphs. The more line graphs the better. Other weather apps have the temp and precipitation on one line graph right off the bat, that would be fantastic. \n- This app would be just about perfect if one could reorder the sections. \n- A more condensed version would be great too. This app involves a LOT of scrolling just to get basic information\n\nI\u2019m coming off as critical but as it stands this is a great app betting to be awesome.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Great graphics, but there are functional problems. The home location registers to a city 10 or 12 miles away from where I actually live, and the radar animation is horrible. One frame loads and then the entire screen blanks before the next frame loads. It makes it almost unusable except as a snapshot of what is actually happening at the moment.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Like the others giving positive reviews, the U.I. for this app is fantastic; clean, has all the info I need at a glance and then some. \n\nThat said, the only reason I'm not giving it 4 or 5 stars is the startup time. With the native weather app, I go from a cold start to know the current temp and daily high in ~2 to 3 seconds.  With TodayWeather, that time is usually around 15-16 seconds.\n\nJust a minor annoyance that'll keep me from buying the pro upgrade or using it as my primary day-to-day.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I used to not write the review of app in App Store, but this is a exception. TodayWeather is the most beautiful weather app with modern design and possibility to change an operator. I recommend for everyone!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Radar needs to be free, too many apps with \"free radar\". On an iPad needs to be able to use in landscape mode.  Should be able to personalize locations.  Go back to the drawing board...","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I heard about this app a while back and was disappointed when it was only available on android, however when I saw that it had became available on iPhone I immediately downloaded it. It truly is a beautiful, aesthetically pleasing, useful app which I believe is superior to other weather apps.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"And have written three emails to the developer and have not received any reply. I am not getting alerts when using Dark Sky, which I have a paid subscription to and now all of my sunny and partly sunny conditions have photos of rain?? Seriously dude, answer your customer emails and fix this stuff","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app is really nice but I've encountered some bugs.I bought the life time subscription and it won't let me restore it on other devices, this is really frustrating. Another bug is that the radar maps causes the entire app to crash when I click on the three dots on the top right corner. The iPad version should also support landscape mode and split view too.

I like how it is different from the other weather apps I've installed. \n\nOne recommendation: if inHg is selected in Units, it needs to be displayed to two decimal places to be meaningful. Also, units in forecast should match what is selected in settings (if Fahrenheit is selected for temperature, then the forecast should not show Celsius).","category":"Weather","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"A good looking app that has the potential to be better.  First up, I really appreciate the selectable weather data sources.  I use Dark Sky. The UI is clean and the widget is nice as well.   For most of my weather info, I go directly to the app widget and rarely go into apps.  About the widget, I would prefer that it showed a 4 or 5 day future forecast rather than the daily hourly forecast.  Perhaps a configuration option?  \n\nLastly, I wasn't able to subscribe which I suspect was due to server authentication issues.  Hope that gets fixed.  I sent an email to the developer about the Widget request but have yet to hear back.  Hopefully, will hear back soon.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"The app is beautiful and it presents a lot of weather data in a very appealing way but this also rough around the edges. \nThe app has ads which can eliminate by paying for a subscription. It should note that in the App Store. And if you try paying for a subscription the process just spins and goes nowhere. Also I noted a preference for Fahrenheit temperatures but the app is not fully consistent with that. I'm sure it will be a five star app very soon. Just not quite yet.","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

Shame on them!  Also, they\u2019ve managed to remove reviews that they don\u2019t like.

Currently it FALSELY indicates several weather \u201cincidents\u201d that have not occurred. Example... app indicates tornado damage 9 minutes ago in Stuttgart. AR. There has been no bad weather in Arkansas today. FALSE\/FAKE weather reports should be eliminated. If your developers cannot fix these issues you should either get new developers or shut down the app. \n\n11\/23\/2018 APP STILL RATED 1 BECAUSE THERE IS NO LOWER NUMBER.

Example: At 7:15p today, a FALSE\/FAKE WEATHER REPORT of \u201cwater flowing over campground road 14 minutes ago\u201d. The problem with it is that the incident occurred well over 24 HOURS AGO. Several additional FALSE\/FAKE REPORTS are posted.

Weather report for Conway, AR states \u201cThunderstorm wind damage ... 6 minutes ago.\u201d The problem??? This is the same report this app has been reporting for 3 days. SAD SAD SAD THAT DEVELOPERS CANNOT FIX THE APP & ARE SELLING IT AS ACCURATE. \n\n06\/28\/2018 CONTINUED PHANTOM REPORTING!!! Currently, app indicates 7 reports of storm damage. However, per all 3 local TV stations, as well as National\n Weather Service, today there is no bad weather nor has there been bad wether in the State. THIS APP IS HORRIBLE!!! IT IS A TOTAL FAILURE!!!

SAD SAD SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS FOR THIS APP & ITS DEVELOPERS. \n\n06\/11\/2018 This app CONTINUES to be HORRIBLE! It\u2019s rated 1 star only because there is no lower possible rating. \nLOTS OF PHANTOM REPORTING OR, AT BEST,  LATE REPORTING. Example: 9:01a CDT today, app reported a \u201c1 minute ago ... man struck by lightning in Maumelle, AR...\u201d While a man was struck by lightning, the problem is that it occurred 3 days ago ... not \u201c1 minute ago\u201d. Again, at 10:48a CDT, the report states \u201c3 minutes ago ... man struck by lightning in Maumelle, AR ...\u201d THIS DOCUMENTS THE INACCURATE REPORTING. Also, there are SEVERAL OTHER WEATHER INCIDENTS \u201cx minutes ago ...\u201d of hail, wind damage, heavy rain, etc. However, except for the extreme\nSE corner of the state, there\u2019s no clouds, rain, storms, etc. reported by The Weather Channel or 3 local TV stations.

Probably the absolute worst time to FORCE an app on people without providing something that is actually useful. For people who live in an area where the sirens aren\u2019t effective, they rely on accurate radars\/apps to be proactive in watching weather. Please PLEASE fix this and bring back the capabilities of the old Storm app!!","category":"Weather","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"The guides are essential but good. However there is a very weak point: for $8.99 you cannot slack leaving text in French and not running a spellcheck in the content. \nIn the Rome guide, for example, the Colosseum (Colosseo) is left in French (Colisee) and many other titles. The Barcaccia (means ugly boat in Italian) is misspelled as \u201cBarbaccia\u201d (ugly beard). Your guides should be built with the same standards as your expensive bags.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"While trying to be fancy, the app was only able to be very weak. Mostly text, almost without pictures, the app forgets it is on a multimedia device and does something I have not seen even in very old travel books. \n\nEven though I have tons of apps I\u2019ve downloaded but never really use, this one was not worth the space it would take on my 128gb iPad, so I have already deleted it.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Bit of a rip off if you pay $8.99 for a city guide, then the update comes 6 to 12 month later and you have to pay the $8.99 again to get the updated version. Not happy with this. Not worth the money for what they recommend in each city guide. Google offers a cheaper alternative for places in the city.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I don't easily leave a 5* review - I really love this gorgeous app. I have a physical lv guide as well as the download of a couple digital versions through this app. I love these guides because they advocate local, interesting, unique locations - the digital versions keep updating with new tips, so quarterly you get great new stuff. I love the innovative piece of choosing between 24 hours in the location or simply wanting hotspots or itineraries. I often get bored with regular city guides and hate to end up in tourist traps - I don't want to have to read a guide I need to discriminate, I'd rather get a great selection of classics, trends & local gems. With these guides in only 5 minutes I have great ideas and unique locations I want to visit (often telling you the best time of day to go, too, to avoid crowds). It's a guide that obviously frowns on a bland touristy trip  - instead helping you create a beautiful, unique and timeless travel experience.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

The tickets only load half the time, and once logged me out as I was getting close to the gate forcing me to dig for my wallet I wasn't expecting to use. But by far the most egregious offensive is the app has keeps experiencing server issues EVERYTIME I want to purchase MaxPass, EVERYDAY! And we're in the parks on weekdays, not even weekends. If I try to add this to our tickets when we're back at the hotel for the next day, it says you have to be in the park to purchase.

I didn\u2019t look at the patio as I assumed there was an awning or some umbrellas, but there wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t learn this until I had spent nearly $50 buying lunch for my family and i started to head outside with trays of hot food, it was pouring outside. I was surprised to find no place to take shelter. No staff attempted to help or redirect guests who were walking in the main entrance unaware that they were expected to eat in the rain. \n\nStuck with food, I returned inside to find a dry corner to try and quickly eat my lunch only to have staff tell me (rather rudely) that I wasn\u2019t allowed to eat inside. As I spoke to the young man about it being unreasonable to expect people to eat hot bowls of soup in the rain he was very snarky and told me I should have thought about that before I came inside the restaurant. I found his tone so obnoxious that I asked to speak to a manager. To which, he said \u201cwhy?\u201d When I said I wanted to share my experience of dinning with the manager the staff member began to argue with me. Again, I had to ask to speak to the manager. \n\nEventually, a man named Sal that identified himself as a manager spoke with me. Sal was very professional and seemed to understand my complaint that guests should be warned when they enter that they will have to eat in the rain. \n\nSal was very good, but as I have gone through the day i have remained irritated by the interaction with the young staffer and I hope is spoken to about quality customer service.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Honestly love having everything for my trip to DL in one place, but this needs some serious polishing, specifically around optimizing urgent loads, like fast passes, and surfacing useful information at a glance. I have two recommendations. First, make ticket and fast pass loads the first loads. I usually need those the moment I pull out my phone and open the app in line to enter the park or get on a ride. It\u2019s imperative that those are available immediately when they\u2019re requested. Secondly, there needs to be a different icon for rides that are closed than the \u201cbundle\u201d icon that holds multiple pieces of information. The map would be twice as useful with that. If that bundle icon could be improved as well it would be nice. For example trying to find a charging swap station is next to impossible. I have to touch almost every bundle icon, which includes closed rides. These two things would make the app almost impeccable for me.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

If I\u2019m logged into my Disney account and you know I have the Southern California passport, why not just tell me if I\u2019m blocked out or not?  Instead I have to click 7 times to figure it out.

Sometimes the WiFi is too weak to use while in an inside queuing line. Advertised price is not the price you pay.

(Using ATT, Verizon, T-mobile, Sprint) no park WiFi, using various IPhone models from the 6 to newest XR.\n\nThe park also needs to invest in a park WIFI network which they could leverage to increase the  customer interaction and overall experience.

Not a good value- and had a so so time with crowds. Actually- I am angry","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

Even though I purchased the MaxPass in the annual pass, it wouldn\u2019t let me fastpass from the app. I went to guest services and spent 20 minutes before being sent back to the ticket kiosk outside of the park. There I stood in line for 25 minutes only to be told \u201cunfortunately, it takes 24 hours for the annual pass to be active with fastpass.\u201d Wow, spend $1600 and then that? They finally issued me a new ticket for the day with maxpass and gave me a fastpass voucher for any ride. Wow, thanks for that. I only spent 1+ hour standing in line and talking to solve this problem that all started when I upgraded to an Annual Pass through this app. Don\u2019t do it.

What a waste of money, at least for me.\n\nUpdate: now I get it, after you buy the app is when you realize that if you want it to really work for the purpose you bought it, you have to pay $5 monthly to get recent data, 2018 but you don\u2019t know the date period. Otherwise you have to stick with almost three years old data, you don\u2019t need to pay even one dollar for that, other FREE sites show you more recent data, not from 2015 and 2016!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I really enjoy this app\u2019s concept. \n\nAnd I was convinced that this would be a great and reliable way to avoid bad areas... until dug a little deeper.\n\nI looked up the crime rate for an affluent area I lived at not too long ago, and I was surprised to find that it was above the national average above 6.\n\nThis really surprised me, as this address was in one of the safest areas in the city, with some of the most expensive homes in that state. I suspected that something was wrong.\n\nI decided to compare this and other neighborhoods on other crime tracking websites, and I found that often times they didn\u2019t match at all. Some websites listed high crime areas in places that the app displayed green, and vice versa. Some of those websites also listed locations and descriptions of reported crimes, and they didn\u2019t really track well with what the app displays. One area was dark red in the app, but didn\u2019t show up as having reported crimes from other websites.\n\nSo really, if the data is questionable, what conclusions can you safely draw from using the app? One cannot confirm that the app is working as intended by saying crimes that weren\u2019t committed to them. \n\nI feel the developer can improve the app by disclosing where the data comes from, and perhaps adding markers of reported crimes in specific areas so we can better see what goes behind the color.\n\nI want to be able to trust this app, and I hope the developer takes these considerations in mind.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

Before booking a hotel or air bnb, I can use the app to see the area before booking.   Since I am often on foot when traveling, knowing I am choosing a safe area, in advance, is very comforting. \n\n I find the app to be very helpful when traveling to an unfamiliar places.   Recently on a vacation, I was without a car, looking for a place to eat dinner.  Using the compass and  map, I was able to determine areas I might want to avoid walking through.  After exploring I found a wonderful meal and made it back to the hotel without those feelings of unease and doubt that can often accompany traveling in an unfamiliar place; it was almost like having a local help guide the way.

{"body":"As a female college student going to school in a sometimes sketchy part of town, this app is invaluable.  I feel much safer going places by myself knowing I will get a notification before walking or driving into a more dangerous area.  I have also found it to be very useful when traveling.  I take a lot of road trips and often have to stop at a campground in a city on my way to my final location.  It\u2019s really helpful to be able to check out the area a campground is in before I make a reservation to determine if I\u2019m comfortable staying there! I always take advantage of the high crime area notifications. It's nice to have one persons phone open to this app while the other is on navigation during road trips. if it seems like you're approaching a sketchy area, let navigation reroute you and go a different way. \n\nApp is frequently updated and I've never had any issues with crashing.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

With a child who will be heading off to college in a couple of years, we will definitely be using Crime & Place when visiting schools around the country.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"All is takes is one wrong turn off an exit you expected to be safe when  looking for a hotel or gas late at night in an unfamiliar place to make you realize how essential this app is. Especially As a mom,  I recall all the road trips I\u2019ve taken alone or with other moms to our students\u2019  sporting events in other states and how often we realized we needed gas only to find out we were in a sketchy area.  Or we were choosing a hotel before departure and wondered why one hotel of a particular chain might be cheaper than another. I\u2019m not concerned with the price of this app\u2026.it\u2019s priceless as far as I\u2019m concerned.  I use it and I bought it for my college student, too. \nI used it just last week on an 1800 mile road trip to choose a place to spend the night.  My first choice turned out to be in an orange zone, or I went to the next exit which was green.  Safety!  I can think of dozens of reasons to have this app on my home page, but if you happen to be an avid road tripper, or travel in an RV and boondock at Wal-Marts it is essential.  More than once I have navigated to a Wal-Mart that allowed overnight parking when I was dog tired, only to realize...nope, not tonight, not ever, and had to press on.  This app takes the guess work out of wondering where you'll be safe and where you might not be.  Priceless.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I saw an ad for this via Instagram and like many others it caught my eye. I searched on google found the website which tells you to download the app. I download the app to find out there is a monthly fee for deals you can find on other sites for free.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I got a notification every month about a trip that wasn't in my state or country... And during the free month, that was the case too .... I would like a refund cuz it was pure garbage and I felt like the 9.99 you are charging it's a RIP-OFF !!! I could of spent $10 on something better \ud83d\ude21","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"You will not get a month free you are charged $49.99 + tax immediately. It's only beneficial to those that live in major cities. There is no search engines or filters to help with find flights. It's just not a good app and definitely not worth $50+ dollars and you may not even find a flight in your city. Don't waste your time with this app.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I live in NYC and nowhere else have I found such low prices on round-trip flights. I have flown to LA and Hong Kong for vacation and saved so much just by having this. They always send me real bargains to quality locations like Paris, Hawaii, etc. If you're a frequent flyer like me, this is more than worth your while. Just a note though, act fast when a new deal comes up, as that depends on how long the airline keeps it up","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

The deals they described sounded unbelievable...like too unbelievable!\n\nSo I was ecstatic when I got an alert to my phone for a deal from New York to London for just $198 round trip.

{"body":"This has made our trips so much better. Not only have we been able to see so many sights that we had never seen before, we didn\u2019t have to spend time researching the island before coming over. Shaka gives so much information on the islands and is great at storytelling.  Highly recommend this app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"By using this app we not only saw some amazing sights we would have never found on our own, but the wonderful stories told by our guide just added a depth and color to our first trip to Hawaii!   We loved this app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I don\u2019t normally leave reviews for apps but you should know this is very well done. \nI typically buy some type of tour guide when I go to Hawaii or want to explore a new place, worth it to find adventure. \nI believe I bought the app made to explore one of the other islands about 3 years ago and I though it was great because it would show you on a map where the different internet points where. \nThis app takes that and uses GPS and completely guides you the whole way. It\u2019s like the dude is in the car with you telling you exactly when to turn and when to look. \nYou can tell these guys spent a lot of time getting down the timing of what is being said to where you are driving. \nBesides the fact that they are telling you what to see and where to go, they are providing history, context and even a little humor. \nHonestly, they did a great job on this and it was money well spent.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"There is no way we would have ventured up this way from Kona without the guide.  So beautiful and such varied landscapes!  Thank you!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My wife and I used this app to tour Hawai\u2019i on our first trip out together and had a great experience. It\u2019s informative, fun, and works as advertised. Highly recommended for discerning tourists. Mahalo to the producers of this app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"If you like a road trip, don\u2019t try doing one in Hawaii without Shaka Guide. We used 3 apps on Big Island, Maui and Oahu. Easy to follow directions, fun and informative. We saw many hidden treasure we would\u2019ve been sure to have missed if we\u2019d have gone at it alone. The food recommendations ensured we had \u2018ono grinds and by our 8th tour we were even singing along to some of the tunes and testing one another on the local legends!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My family and I came to the Big Island. We purchased the tour bundle and did almost all of them. So amazing! And we thought it was very inexpensive for what it is :)","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Love the concept and for the most part was satisfied however as you know the park has seen some major changes in the past 6 months and the app has not been updated.\nA bit glitchy at times... switching chapters in mid story. I would suggest some more video content like photos of prominent features, and things like flora and fauna, pele\u2019s hair and tears and the like!  \nKeep it up as I can\u2019t wait for these tours to get better and better!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"This was our third Shaka Guide tour, and we loved this one too!  Although we didn\u2019t have any flowing lava in the park (Dec 2018), we enjoyed the mini hikes with our kids, the legends and history, and the tips!  We even saw a pod of dolphins and a whale by the sea arch!!!  Mahalo!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The content is great, and maybe just a bit better than the other Hawaii drive-along guidebook app, which I\u2019ve also tried. \n\nThe app works, but could be a bit smoother. \n\nIt is disappointing that when you buy content for the app you can\u2019t share it to other devices via family sharing. If you\u2019re traveling with a partner or a family, it means the guide content is locked to one device.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Spectacular tour. Incredibly accurate and informative. We thank you so much for the great lesson. Can\u2019t wait for your other tours.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"App either didn\u2019t work properly (driving for miles past many landmarks along Chain of Craters Rd. w\/o any audio commentary) or else it offered useless guided info (look to your left and you\u2019ll see something you really don\u2019t need a guide to point out because there\u2019s visible signs and dozens of cars pulled over). Spend 15 minutes online or 5 minutes chatting w a park ranger and a printed VNP map and you\u2019ll do just as well, if not better. Don\u2019t bother wasting your money on this.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This was a fun (in a cheesy way) tour through the Volcano National Park. I wish that there were other tour options for the big island though. Right now, the national park tour is it - even though the big island has so so much to offer! Get to it Shaka!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"We enjoyed using Shaka Guide on Maui and Kauai and we were really looking forward to downloading a tour on the Big Island but unfortunately Volcanoes National Park is closed due to the Kilauea eruptions and earthquakes. No fault to Shaka Guide for this inconvenience, but we would have loved to see another tour option to use on the Big Island.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"How sad your one tour is not available due to the volcano being a spoil sport. After your Kauai tours, we were hoping for something for Hilo, Saddleback or Kona areas! \n\nSigh. Please add for others who are interested in this amazing island!\n\nFor anyone wanting to get close as you can to the volcano, you can see a beautiful sight of the lava reflected in the clouds if you drive up to Pahoa Middle School. There\u2019s a church with a mini church in front of it. From the grass in front of the church you have the best view. Really spectacular after sunset! The tiny coqui frogs were interesting addition since we were here last. Much louder and more plentiful than chickens in West Kapa\u2019a!\nMahalo for da kine and ono tours in Kauai, please make more for the Big Island! \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd19","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"We used the Road to Hana first when visiting Maui  and being so useful we decided to purchase  the Big Island and Ohau for the next portion of out trip. \nBoth works very well. Highly recommended.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This guide of Volcano National Park was great.  It was spot on with every point of interest and showed all the main places to see.  It even showed some sights that there are absolutely no signs for that were awesome.  In between points of interest it gave a history of Hawaiian culture.  The GPS and offline maps were in perfect sync and it even knew which way you were driving in case you turned around to head back in a different spot than planned. Probably the best purchase I have ever made on the App Store.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My wife and I absolutely loved this self guided tour. We used this app on all the islands we visited and every single time was amazing. Would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a fun day of sight seeing and hiking.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"On a whim we tried Shaka\u2019s Road to Hana tour on Maui.  We were hooked! It really is like having a local tour guide in your car, one that is both entertaining and informative.  The app worked well for us, used our phone GPS instead of data, and provided helpful options to preview and review the tour.  We ended up buying their tours for everywhere we went\u2014Maui\u2019s Road to Hana and Haleakal\u0101, Kauai\u2019s Waimea Canyon and North Shore, and the Big Island\u2019s Volcanoes National Park.  Unfortunately their Big Island Circle tour is still under development, so we tried the competitor driving tour app.  It was informative, but dry and not as user-friendly.  We were so glad to hear Shaka\u2019s friendly voice and corny jokes when we did the Volcanoes loop!  Enthusiastically recommend!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We purchased and used the Big Island and Kauai North Shore driving tours. This was the best money we spent on our two week vacation! The only regret we had is we did not see the Na Pali tour before we headed out on our own. We thoroughly enjoyed both of these tours!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great App , told you where to go, what to do, what to skip if short on time. Told Hawaiian stories along the way.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"These guides are amazing! My wife and I used both the Oahu and Big Island guides, we thoroughly enjoyed following both tours. It\u2019s so nice being guided around with out having anyone else on the ride with you, and for a fraction of the price for an actual tour group lol! A+++!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"It\u2019s like having your own tour guide right in your car!  Allot of thought has gone into making this app accurate to your location and giving you tips on where to go and what to see while you are visiting VNP. Very well worth the small cost to get this app!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This tour was spot on during our drive through Volcano National Park. We downloaded it from our hotel and had our GPS location turned on. The voice started right on target and told us what was coming up or what we were seeing.

We are sharing this App with our friends who are planning a trip to Oahu and Maui in March.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Shaka Guide is awesome. Let's you be independent. Keeps you off the tour bus, where the slowest\/lowest common denominator sets the pace.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Long story short, the app and purchase for the big island volcano were more than worth it.  Download and buy it NOW!! \n\nNow for the long story.... the overall guided tour WILL take about 3 hours or more. It really depends on how fast you move. \n\nA few thoughts I have, arrive around 1 PM do the audio tour.... at sunset go to dinner. Relax and enjoy a dinner. 2 hours later come back to the museum and check out the crater. During the night you will see the orange glow of the volcano as you approach it.  \n\nAgain simply an amazing app \/ purchase ... I will be purchasing more Shaka Guides.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I hadn\u2019t expected from volcano park a lot, but this app did its job. Like personal guide with you. I\u2019d like to see such tours for all the parks. Also it would be nice to have one app containing all the tours.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Fun, unique tour if the volcano National Park. Loved the tips and stories from the app. It made our trip so much easier.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"If you are visiting a Hawaiian island, get the Shaka Guide for it. \n\nI\u2019ve visited 3 Hawaiian islands with my wife and done Shaka tours on all 3 of them - those days are easily highlights in our vacation!\n\nShaka Guides are exceptional. The very thoughtful design never leaves you wondering where to go. Audio queues are on point and very explanatory. The delivery is exceptional - the voice guiding you along the way is friendly, warm, educational and fun. But most importantly, the content is top notch!! I love the Hawaiian legends and cultural tidbits as much as the scientific explanations - exactly what I want from a tour guide. \n\nThe Volcano tour on the Big Island is no exception. Although less colorful than the Kauai and Maui stories, Shaka Guides do a great job at being a great companion alongside lava.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Our family loved this app. The stories and information were great for grown ups and kids. We had insider information about where to hike and lots of fun stories to entertain our 6 year old. We will be looking for more tours in the future!\n\nGreat value for this GPS guided tour. Worked perfectly.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Really enjoyed the app.  It made for an interesting story narration as well as fun filled fact trip around Volcano National Park and surrounding towns.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is worth way more than $4, in my opinion! I LOVED the guide (Gray). His voice was like buttah. So smooth and easy on the ears. As a fellow voice over artist, I appreciate fantastic voice-over work when I hear it!!! It was a joy to listen to. Our van full of people really enjoyed the stories, information, and the jokes (which we repeated for the remainder of our trip). I recommend this app to you if you're driving yourself through Hawaii Volcanoes Nat'l Park. I can't wait to hear the other tours they're developing for the Big Island! Mahalo for everyone's hard work in making this awesome app!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was the best value out of all the activities we spent money on at the Big Island. Excellently narrated, funny, interesting and great advice. Shame they only currently have a guide for the volcano drive\/hike tour but I look forward to seeing other tour guides for the Big Island when we return in a few years time.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"By far the best tour guide app I have seen!!!  The information was timely, relevant and exactly what we needed to gain context to Hawaiis history and culture. The stories were funny, informative and really engaging -- they peeked our interest at every stop.  I wish Shaka would make these for every major city cause they are spot on!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was fantastic!  We got a late start from the Kona side of the island and could not have made it through the park without this app.  We missed a few hikes, mainly because of rain, but just means we will have to go back.  Just need to come up with apps for the rest of the Big Island.\n\nWe were also on Kaua'i and used the Shaka tour apps for the North Shore and Waimea Canyon tours.  Again, they were fantastic, with great detail.  I especially liked the history.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Provided an excellent guide although we didn't use it until we got to the Visitor Center.  Keeps you on task so you don't waste any of your time at the park","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Used the Shaka app in VNP and saw others doing the same.  Loved going at our own pace and spending as much time as WE wanted to at each stop WE wanted to make.  My favorite was the stop that is not included on park maps!   Thanks so much.  This is genius!!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This paid for my 2 week rental car. Family made jokes at first but once they heard what was being said they would listen in and ask to replay.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Our family enjoyed the Volcano NP tour immensely. We spent two days at the park and we're able to do parts of the tour on both days. Love how it knows exactly where you are and adjusts based on your location. There are even different stories\/info based on which direction you are going.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We did multiple tours from Shaka Guide in Maui and liked it so much we did the tour on the Big Island too. Highly recommend it.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is wonderful and awesome and lives up to the great reviews. However, we needed it to go in reverse. We didn't start down Chain of Craters road until around 3:00. The first few attractions it described were great! I love the local insights and stories. However, The sea arch sounded really neat so we ignored all of the other stops and headed there next so we wouldn't run out of daylight. But then, on the way back it wouldn't talk about the attractions like it had on the way down. Is there a way to turn it around and have it talk about them from either direction? Other than that we loved it and would use more tours on it.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"We loved this app and all the info that it provided on what to see inside Volcanoes National Park and the stories that went along with them. We rented a car and drove through the park ourselves. The tour is guided by your GPS location so it's always relative to what you are seeing. We even got to walk up to Devil's Throat crater that wasn't even on the map because the guide recommended it. The rich stories brought this Park to life in a way I never expected. You can even download the tour ahead of time so that it doesn't use any cellular data on the drive. \n\nIf you're planning on driving through Volcanoes National Park, I highly recommend you take this app with you.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is a great app when you visit this island!   Much culture, history, music, and directions -- all without using data.  Turn your navigation system off and use Shaka instead!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My teenage son and I came to the Big Island and didn't want to be herded around like cattle on a tour nor did I want to spend $150+ per person to see the Volcanoes. We downloaded the App, rented a car and set out on our adventure. At first I didn't think my teenager would be listening to the stories or even be interested but he not only listened, he repeated them several times throughout the trip!  One of the best things about the trip were the hidden secrets and the best places to stop or keep going. There was one stop called the Devils Throat with no signs and was the \"best kept secret\". We pulled over on the side of the road and someone following us pulled over too. When we got out and walked down a small dirt path, whoever was in the car behind us decided to keep going since there were no signs as to what we were visiting. Too bad for them!  It was so exhilarating to see this crater ... even a little eerie and definitely the best view of all the views. Needless to say ... this was ABSOLUTELY the best tour App I've ever downloaded!  Hopefully you will leave the Islands and travel around other places and create the same app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"If you drive through Big Island Volcano National Park by car, I highly recommend this App. Great guide, GPS guided (it knows where you are and therefore guides at the right time). Tells you also some secret places not on the park map and recommends what to leave out (they are right!). Its also funny. When the tour is finished and you drive back uphill from the ocean, they narrate different Hawaiian stories. Simply nice! I am sad the other Big Island tour guides are not available yet (soon to come). I would buy them all! But not sure when and if I return to Big Island.\n\nPS: Have an USB 12V charger for the cellphone and a cellphone holder for the car. Just makes your life easier.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We were travelling with a car-full of boys, 9 to 12 years old, and wanted them to pay attention to the scenery of this beautiful drive rather than just playing their video games in the car.  They were skeptical but were immediately enthralled and entertained by the guided narration.  The guide was fun and helpful, pointing out interesting side trips that we would have passed up otherwise, and helping us avoid crowded areas that would have wasted our time.  This app added so much value to our vacation.  It should exist for every single vacation area in America.  Not just Hawaii.  Thank you!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The app is simple and easy to use. Shaka clearly spent time & $ making the UI refined, colorful and intuitive. But they really shine with the content. We used the Hawaii Volcanos tour from Hilo through Jaggar and all the way down to the Petroglyphs. The Guide was informative in a folksy way, knew his Hawaiian pronunciations, and let us know the best places to stop as well as skip. Each stop was anticipated and described so we were more informed and prepared than the tourists around us. Even better, the long ride back up the Chain of Craters road was filled with tales and stories - helped keep our child from getting bored. Such a great value - we highly recommend this app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The timing on this app is perfect. The trigger points allow for the illusion that there is a tour guide in your backseat. \nThe GPS tracking is a great decision since there loss of cell phone service throughout the park. And being able to download the audio files prior to leaving the house on our days adventure adds even greater piece of mind. \n\nWell done on this app. $4 is a great price point for this service. Looking forward to more tours on the big island.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We spent the day at Hawaii Volcanos National Park and had an amazing day thanks to this Audioguide.  While the sites were spectacular, our experienced was enhanced by the guide as we drove through the park. We heard the folklore about the volcanos, learned the history of the Park and even saw some unmarked sites that are not on the regular map--none of which we would have experienced without the Audioguide.  \nIf you are planning a trip to the Volcanoes, I would definitely download this app.  We did not have our kids with us this trip but, they would have enjoyed it as well.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

As you pass certain areas, it kicks in and gives you great information about what your seeing. A great value and a must for seeing the sights inside the park. This is well worth the price!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"The audio guide is spot-on with recommended tour stops, hikes, and vantage points. The GPS-enabled tour was eerily accurate, and not having to be connected to cellular service (not available in all parts of the park) is genius. Very easy to follow the directions to the tour. Awesome and engaging narration as well- my 8 year old son said, \"this guide has some good stories!\" We will definitely be using the other audio tour apps on future Hawaii trips. Cannot recommend or love this app enough! Thank you!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"We downloaded and bought this tour after enjoying the Shaka guide during our stay in Maui over the last few days. As with the Maui tour, it's as if you've hired a personal tour for an impossibly small fraction of the price. From now on, I'm going to look into similar types of tours any time I travel. Easily the best money we spent on our trip to Hawaii.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This is a great audio audio tour. I really like to have a GPS tied into where you were so that way you do not have to stop and start the audio. It a great job giving you recommendations on what to see given how much time you had. The stories in the legends kept my kids entertained as we made the drive through the park.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Made for such a more enjoyable trip, the right mix of facts and legend, god points of interest made for a great trip- thank you. Without the app I'd venture to say the tour of the park would have only taken half the time and none of the legend or fact data except what the park provided. I'll use this provider for other areas of the islands now too.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We just spent the day at Volcanoes National Park. This app completely made our day! My nieces (9 and 11) and the entire family enjoyed the stories and all narratives. We also loved the Devil's Throat tip. Well done!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We loved using this guide!!  Directions were easy to follow and stories were informative and fun!!!  We also used the ones for Kauai and they were just as good.  We had to use a guidebook and companions app for the rest of the big island and it wasn't nearly as good.  Highly recommended!! Thank you!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Very good app. Made our trip to Hawaii easier to plan. Wish we found it earlier. Well worth a few bucks!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"If you\u2019ve got a car (and USB charger for your phone), all you need is this app. We rode through the Volcano national park with this app pointing out all the cool things automatically along the way via GPS (no data needed!). It allowed us to take our time and stop places we wanted to or skip those we didn\u2019t. Didn\u2019t have to suffer from expensive tours and other tourists in a group.  Definitely a must-have\u2026wish there were more downloads for these apps, but I know they are coming soon. Great idea!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This has made our trips so much better. Not only have we been able to see so many sights that we had never seen before, we didn\u2019t have to spend time researching the island before coming over. Shaka gives so much information on the islands and is great at storytelling.  Highly recommend this app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Usually I get annoyed with cookies when I get pop ups on my social media apps, but I am thankful that this app popped up. I decided to read the reviews and go from there. I ended up purchasing the Kauai tours. It is fabulous! I learned so much and go to see so many more things than I would have on my own. I highly recommend this app.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Super app. Someone on a tour told us about this app. We only had issues when we were using a non-Apple charging cord. Switched cords and all was well. Did the Kauai tours and will download the other islands if we return for vacation. Highly recommend","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Very well designed app that knows were you\u2019re at via GPS and generates a tour based on your driving speed.  Excellent value!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"If you are wanting to tour the island and get the inside scoop on history and places to go, this is the app. Best find ever!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The family LOVED this app! we used it for our Kauai trip and it was great, we would have never experienced spam musubi if we didn\u2019t get directed past the little tiny store selling it! The dude narrating the app is hilarious. It made our trip even more fun and I as the Dad and driver had a copilot in this app. Made viewing the many MANY awesome sights even easier.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"We heard about this app from another couple we met on the first day in Kauai.  I\u2019m so happy that they told us about it.  It totally made our trip fun filled.  We had planned on driving around and seeing the sights, but this app made it the perfect trip of a lifetime.  \n\nI had just one small complaint and that was the amount of left turns in a high traffic locations, but we were able to see and do things that I would of never seen without this app.  \n\nThank you.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app and its programs are absolutely amazing! I am a naturalist and certified interpretive guide who can\u2019t wait to get out there using Shaka! Really fantastic recommendations when it comes to food, viewpoints and in general great places that are worth the stop on Kauai.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"We recently used the Shaka Guide for our trip to Kauai. Absolutely worth the money and so many interesting stories!! I would add that the top of Waimea Canton is super cold, we weren\u2019t prepared for that, but other than that we very much enjoyed the app, stories, and tour guide!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"We\u2019ve used this app for both Maui and Kauai and all the tours are awesome. It\u2019s like having a private tour guide in the car with us. I only wish I could take them with on the walking or hiking parts.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Our first time on the island we wanted to explore. This app was an excellent guide to the special sites with colorful commentary. This app was just what we needed.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The Shaka Guide Apps are a terrific way to see the various islands of Hawaii. They will make sure you see all of the big sites but also take you off the beaten track to places that you\u2019d otherwise miss. It is so easy to use. You won\u2019t miss anything that you don\u2019t want to! Highly recommended!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I bought all the Kauai tours for a family trip last year and it was the best money I spent all vacation. We became obnoxious evangelists for the app working it into every conversation we had. I should get a commission for all the new downloads they got from us!\ud83d\ude0f \nIt\u2019s so much fun, the kids loved it, and it seemed to read our minds for snack stops and beach time. It\u2019s a Hawaii \u2018Must Have\u2019.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Tour was very well done and  very entertaining and let you tour at your own pace. We saw some beautiful sites. Highly recommend this driving tour. The Waimea Canyon Is definitely the Grand Canyon of the pacific.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great app used it on Maui and Kauai, very useful user friendly and informative. I learned so much more Hawaiian than in a guidebook. Mahalo.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The content is really good. Many of the tours are loops and the navigating to the start of 2\/4 of the tours did not work well which had us driving in circles for hours. Once we could get started, it worked great but mostly it didn\u2019t.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I have purchase 3 times now. Sitting here with Wi-Fi waiting. It just spins \u201cverifying\u201d purchase\u201d. \nWould love to up the stars but so far we are loosing time waiting for this to start downloading. Which it is not doing.\nUpdate:The number for tech support is \u202d1 (888) 250-2261\u202c. Tech support was great and figured out the problem. Will finish rating after The tour.\nUpdate: (and upping my star rating) the tour is great, tech support was great and I highly recommend the tour.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Used it to tour Waimea Canyon.  Easy to use and guided us to places we wouldn\u2019t have found on our own.  Worth the price.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Love this app! You have to drive a lot to see all of Kauai, and this app showed us lots of neat sports that we wouldn\u2019t have discovered otherwise along the way. It includes some really interesting Hawaiian history and legends, and the gps function works great to pick up regardless of where you start or what order you go in. Definitely would recommend!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I resist packaged tours preferring to travel at my own speed and side trips. This app is perfect in that I can still travel as I like but don\u2019t miss hidden gems along the way and here interesting facts, history, and legends along the way. Very pleased with the app and value of this tool.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My husband, myself and my adult children have been listening to this guide. We have a few suggestions. \nFirst, we didn\u2019t enjoy that you couldn\u2019t just hop in and hear about where you were located more easily. It seemed like you should be able to choose between highlights with directions or just highlights. \nAlso, we really wanted to be able to fast forward or rewind a section of the info. \nAlso no offense but the narrators voice is a bit overpowering(maybe too Fun park). \nAnother idea would be to have choices between outdoor fun (hiking), or museums, or  shopping etc. (Maybe make them color coded so you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re wasting time if you\u2019re not into this thing or that). \nThere were also comments about most of the stories seem depressing. (Someone seems to always die) \nAlso it also might be a good idea to have a choice of hearing with or without music. \n\nThings we did enjoy we\u2019re finding some great things on Kauai we never would have without the app. \nAll in all we\u2019ve enjoyed that the app can detect our location and give us insights. \nThanks.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app is amazing!  I did have to download the offline map twice due to a software bug, but it was entirely worth it!  It is essential for anyone visiting the island for the 1st time and may prove interesting even for locals.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great tour with turn by turn instructions. The stories were entertaining and informative. We told everyone we met to download it!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We used this app to find our way through Kauai. It was so easy to use and made our exploration of the island stress free. We learned a lot about the culture and history and were guided to stops we never would have found on our own.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We bought an app for the road to hana, we loved it so much, that we got the one for kauai.   Did the canyon tour today. The GPS system is amazing.   Our guide is fun and full of facts!   Loved how he took us to places we would have drove by.   Highly highly recommend!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We thoroughly enjoyed all four of the tours for Kauai. Each tour took 4-6 hours and was all at our own pace. We could spend as much time exploring each site as we wanted or choose to skip parts due to time constraints. We loved the music, the stories and legends, the trivia, and the opportunity to see things off the typical routes of other tours. A+!  We are waiting for more Tours to be released near us.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Shaka is the best guide for Hawaii. We used it for Maui, Oahu and Kauai and drove through all of the tours. When we were flying to Kauai our friends were asking what we were going to do there. Our answer was - whatever Shaka tells us to do!\nAwesome experience! We will be back for more!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Found this app by accident. Bought all 4 tours for Kaua\u2019i and the app was totally dope. Stopped at all the good places and beaches. Loved the history and kept us from driving around in circles like we normally do. I felt\nLike we got a really good view of the island and stayed longer where we wanted to and less where we didn\u2019t want to. Didn\u2019t have to keep anyone\u2019s schedule but our own! I\u2019d give it 20 stars if I could and will use it for every other island.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Highly recommend taking advantage of Shaka touring guide. Great tips and recommendations. Right on and user friendly app! Thanks!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"First time using this app. I downloaded it for Kauai. It was simple to use, fun information and great music. Notes- This app does not guide you to the first stop from your current location so you\u2019ll need to use your maps to get you there. I didn\u2019t realize that until I drove out of the rental car area. Also advise looking at the list view to see which stops you want and which ones you want to miss. I didn\u2019t realize this until later in my trip but was able to skip some of the stops not of interest. \n I loved the app and would defiantly use it again when coming to the islands.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"It just works!  Informative.  Interesting. Includes a soundtrack! Bang on recommendations for food.  Used it for a family trip with ages ranging from 70 - 13 and everyone liked it.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"A very interesting and informative way to drive the island. My wife (the worst navigator)Love the fact, she did have to give my directions. Also entertaining.\nLove it","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"It took us to beaches and places that we wouldn\u2019t have visited otherwise. It is well synchronized with the gps. Great comments and stories!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I love the fact that the app easily guided us to all of the hotspots, especially those that are off the beaten path. The guide is certainly entertaining (albeit a bit corny at times, but we were ok with that). If you spend thousands of dollars for a Hawaiian vacation, it\u2019s certainly worth a few bucks to maximize the experience.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Be aware, this app doesn\u2019t offer anything free. All the tours must be bought separately! Seriously? Absurd","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Had so much fun chasing waterfalls with this app. I was a little skeptical about the hiking, but the explanations are accurate regarding difficulty levels. App worked flawlessly offline, GPS navigation was spot on. The Hawaiian music and narration are enjoyable. Definitely recommend Shaka guide!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My husband and I wanted to see more of Kauai and this is the perfect app for showing people around with good stories and music along the way. Highly recommend!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Well worth the cost!! Great directions, stories and history of the islands, and off the beaten track hidden gems!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"On a recent trip to Kauai I stumbled upon the app. It was 12 years since our last trip.  I was so thankful that I did not need to navigate during our sightseeing around the island.  The app did it all!  It had directions, history and best of all it knew where we were so we were notified in plenty of time where to pull of or turn.  Thank goodness!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My daughter and I had so much fun with this guided tour of Waimea canyon! The tour guide was funny and shared so many great stories along the way. I would highly recommend this to anyone that isn\u2019t familiar with the area!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I came to Kauai solo and had no clue what to do. In 1 week, I had the island covered with this app, ate some great local food, and experienced some great beaches. One of the best travel apps ever that works off your gps! I wish every place had something like this.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Went on the tours well worth the money. Enjoyed the stories and the destinations. Highly recommended. When I visit the next island we will definitely purchase the tour again.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"It was perfect And very helpful for the drive up Waimea Canyon! Loved all the stories! Highly recommend buying it for any trip! Will use again!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I\u2019m one to literally never write reviews, but we did the NaPali Waimea tour today and it was so wonderful. The antics that the guide gives a great and even had us laughing quite a bit. And the stops were spectacular and we couldn\u2019t have planned it better ourselves. We plan on doing the others here in Kauai and the ones in Maui while on our trip. Highly recommended. I may have missed this, but just tap the starting point on the guide and your phone\u2019s map system will guide you to that and then you can start the guide. That took me a minute to figure out but once we started it was awesome!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Did all four tours and found them interesting and educational. I have been to Kauai before but the tours guided me to many new locations and sites. Well worth the moderate expense.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"You MUST download this app. My suggestion is to start the tours within the first few days of your arrival. Leave yourself plenty of time to go through all the tours. We are leaving tomorrow and we\u2019re only able to do the Waimea canyon tour and regret not leaving enough time to do the other 3. The quality of the narration is excellent and informative and even my 4 year old was listening closely and asking questions. His favorite was \u201cda big foot\u201d legend. The music isn\u2019t constant, I wish there was more in between each narration. Most of the music is really good, although some of it can be a little corny. But it makes the trip memorable. \n\nHands down it was the best 15 bucks I spent on this vacation. I only wish I didn\u2019t have to get the driver so I could absorb some of the sights between the stops, but I\u2019m glad my family got to. \n\nI\u2019ll check to see if this creator has tours if I ever travel anywhere. I hope they do.\n\nA couple of suggestions:\n1. Landscape mode for the app\n2. A bit more notice approaching turns, naming the street. \n3. When you\u2019re approaching the turn, there is a little box that pops up with an arrow and it\u2019s difficult to see the actual intersection on the GPS map. Address this.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I had a 3 night 4 day stay in Kauai and didn\u2019t know what to do with my time here.  A friend told me about the app and i paid for all 4 of the tours, thinking to myself i can\u2019t go wrong.  It was the blast investment ever.  I was able to fit all 4 into my schedule and what i enjoyed the most was the history and the fact that i was not on a tour bus with a lot of other tourists.  I had the convenience of just myself in the rental car. I stopped if i wanted to and or passed what i didn\u2019t mid seeing.  I recommended the app to 5 other people before i left my hotel.  I live on Oahu for3 years now and i plan on purchasing that app just to see if i missed any history or small hidden gems.  This was awesome.  Great job!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Just finished Kauai North Shore tour.  Not only informative but very entertaining... and the cues were always right on the mark.  We seen many unmarked locations which we previously drove right on by.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great way to see all the hidden gems you might likely overlook if exploring on your own.\nYou can do a \u201cfast\u201d tour and just hit the highlights, or really get down in the weeds so to speak.\nIt helps to look over the tour before you head out, there may be some excursions you do not feel you need to spend your time on.\nIt really is like having the guide right there in the car with you.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"This app was awesome! It was easy to follow. The Hawaiian story\u2019s and history on the app were great. Just Bluetooth it to your rental car, push play and off you go. Be sure you download it before you leave. Oh the food suggestions were on point for plenty to choose from. We told people about it and they were so great full.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"There were a couple download bugs but other than that the tours are excellent. Much cheaper than paying for a live tour bus and just as informative and exciting if not moreso. Plus you get to do them at your own pace and skip things you might not want to do. We rented a car and did the 4 bundle pack for Kauai and couldn\u2019t be happier. Also if you do have questions or issues they have a live chat help feature that is really responsive.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I want to thank whoever created this app. This totally brought Kaua\u2019i alive for us, we saw way more cool and interesting things than otherwise possible. It was like driving with a local who guided us turn by turn and explained the culture and history of the island! Truly amazing! Mahalo x 1000!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We had such a fun time following the shaka guide through Waimea canyon. Learned so much and wouldn\u2019t have known about lookouts over napali coast if we hadn\u2019t been listening. Fun stories and music too! Will definitely be recommending to others!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"My husband and I recently used the Shaka app for Kauai and loved all of the driving tours. We had also paid for a guided tour on a small bus while on Oahu and regretted it. Should have done the Shaka guide there too!  Don\u2019t waste your money on a guided tour bus when you can use this app, get the same information PLUS more history, stories and helpful, interesting information about the places you\u2019re driving by. We found the turn by turn directions to be spot on, the back stories very interesting, and overall just loved this app!  Highly recommend and will most definitely use again whenever we can on our travels.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We are visiting Kauai for a few days, and someone at our hotel recommended this app for driving self-tour. We really enjoyed it! It is a great way to see the island, is very well done, gives great turn-by-turn driving directions, and is pretty entertaining as well.  Well worth the price for the paid tour packages.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The \u201cguided tour\u201d is not what I expected or hoped for. You can\u2019t jump in at points and listen on your own route to your destination. It only works if you follow the tour directly. I do not recommend if you are expecting to jump in the car and listen to fun facts on your way to destination. Waste of $. One story doesn\u2019t end before the next begins, when it abruptly cuts off. Yet there are long periods of silence. Poorly done.  App does not pick up local hot spots like you would expect.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"This app made our trip and kept our 3 kids entertained along the way between stops. We loved learning the history and see the places that were off the beaten path. I felt sorry for tourists crammed in buses. I\u2019m sure we had better tours for a fraction of the price and on our own timeframe. Trust me, it\u2019s totally worth the purchase!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We used this app to travel around Kauai, and we had such a wonderful time!  We hit all of the highlights we had planned to see and were pleasantly surprised to go to many less known locations as well.

Awesome travel app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I found a recommendation for this app on Pinterest. For $8 it seemed like a good guide on our way up to explore Waimea Canyon. It started us at Kauai Coffee which was perfect timing as we arrived at 9am. Then told us stories, history, and places to stop as we drove. We hiked Canyon Trail, stopped at lookouts, laughed at the stories and jokes, and saw more than we would have known to look for if not for this app. We\u2019re headed to east side of island soon and will listen to that guide as well. Highly recommend!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

I highly recommend this app to everyone!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Save your money. Don\u2019t purchase this one. \n\nFirst of all I had issues downloading the purchases. I bought the bundle but had to delete and reinstall 3 times in order for it to work. \n\nBe prepared to do a hundred U turns bc you will miss the turns. The Maui tour had a blue line that gave you an idea of where u were going. This one does not. The prompts to turn is way too late and we spent so much time looking for places to do U turns and it was extremely frustrating to the point we just turned it off and used the regular GPS to get to our location. \n\nGreat guide but a really crappy app. Shame.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"My sister and I used this app for the tour of Waimea Canyon and Na Pali. It contains useful information- like, which points of interest have restrooms \ud83d\ude0a. The narration, music and stories are quite enjoyable and we found ourselves talking back to the guide (sometimes saying nope, not gonna do THAT). We also used the Maui\/Road to Hana classic app during our visit. \n\nWe consider the purchase of both apps to be money well spent.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This is a fantastic app. My wife and I enjoyed all 3 tours on Kauai and would highly recommend it to anyone considering the purchase. You won't regret it. Top notch.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app helped SO much!!  SO worth the $$!  Gives so much info and extra perks to seeing stuff that my hubs and I didn\u2019t see the first time we traveled to Hawaii. Definitely worth using at each location You visit!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This guide was really useful in making the most of our time.  We bought a second tour after the first day.  Really appreciated all the tips on driving, local food, bathrooms as well the Hawaiian cultural stories.  Guide allowed us to see things we would have otherwise driven right by as well as helped us to understand what we were seeing.  Highly recommend.  If you have the chance to buy it in advance, advise that you listen to different parts or look at the highlights and figure out which stops you woud like to make if your timing doesn\u2019t allow for the whole tour.  Our whole family enjoyed it very much.  Mahalo!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Hi! We\u2019ve really enjoyed this app on our trip to Kauai. The Waimea Canyon tour was incredible! We were excited to get going on the North Shore tour but were disappointed when we got to Hanalei. A local store owner told us that Hanalei is basically the end of the road since the flooding. Apparently no one besides residents can past Hanalei. Tunnels and Ke\u2019e beach are not accessible. I think that this information should be available in the app until they are open again. We would have chosen a different tour had we known. Otherwise I highly recommend this app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"My husband and I used Shaka guide in Kauai. We loved it!  I did not want to tour on a bus with others so this was perfect for us. We could stop where we wanted or keep on going. Plus we loved the stories and history. After our trip we missed our tour guide!  Six months later we went to Maui with our kids and used Shaka Maui. It was like we were back with an old friend again!  We just booked a trip to go to Oahu in January 2019 and I\u2019m already excited to take the Shaka tour again!  You will not be disappointed.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Excellent bargain, we were very pleased with the tour.  The directions were right on and easy to follow, will definitely use again. Thanks!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"Loved! Loved! Loved this tour!!!!! We took our time & spent the entire day, seeing & learning all about this area!!! I highly recommend!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We used Shaka Guide for our road to Hana trip and found it so helpful that when we flew over to Kauai we just had to get the app for that island too! They point out so many little stops that you would miss if you were trying to do a tour on your own.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Heard about Shaka tours from a friend, and was glad I downloaded the app and guide for Kauai. Enjoyed the history lesson and off the beaten path sites.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Roads washed out at points and could not locate the continuing route.  There was construction preventing access to  route. This as an real waste of Momey  and time. Don\u2019t buy.  App badly needs to be updated,","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Your app made our trip very enjoyable! Trip Directions and historical information and stories were great! We\u2019d definitely recommend your app...and actually did recommend it to another couple we met. We\u2019d like to do a different tour with you in a few days!  Thank you!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We have used other apps like this and enjoyed the experience. The Waimea Canyon tour flat out didn\u2019t work with any consistency at all.  It would tell us one vignette, disappear, and then be gone through one supposed point of interest after another.  I don\u2019t know why, but we couldn\u2019t get it to function.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I downloaded this $8 app for the north shore tour. Each tour you download (there are 3 for Kauai) cost money. There are lots of interest points on the map. Some we went to and some we skipped. It was pretty accurate with the exception of the Hanalei Pier. The road to the pier is \u201cclosed\u201d and only for residents who live on that road. You can enter the beach at the pavilion but then it\u2019s a bit of a walk on the beach to the pier. We enjoyed learning about Hawaiian history and culture!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Great information!!!   Good stories to complement, although most involved the death of a mythical Hawaiian creature.  Overall the app really enhanced the trip.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I don\u2019t mind paying for apps that tell you up front it will cost you. I DO mind apps that first force you to sign in with google or Facebook and share buckets of data with them and only THEN tell you it\u2019s merely a gateway to other apps you must pay for. Total scam app. Booooo.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I\u2019ve never written a review of an app before but this one was simply awesome.  Highly recommend.  We used it for the road to Hana with my family of four (15 year old boy and 19 year old girl). They loved it. We found spots we never would have found. Waterfalls we\u2019d never seen before and wouldn\u2019t have known existed and swimming holes that no one knows about. Once you download the tour, the GPS works to kick in the stories and spots to see on Queue. It recommends skipping some of the more crowded spots and made our trip super efficient and enjoyable. Plus the music was fantastic. This app kept us entertained all day on the drive.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"So much great information on these tours! My family found so many gems in Kaua\u2019i that we never could've seen without this app! Worth every penny!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"First time visiting Kauai and wanted to make the most of our time so found this app. Although I was hesitant we did download it and found it to be very informative and entertaining. It was as if the narrator were sitting in the car with us. That\u2019s how accurate the directions were.  The Hawaiian folklore and island history and facts about the sights kept us all entertained while driving.\nThe hikes and sights were amazing!!  Definitely listen to narrator when describing the hikes...some can be challenging.\nWould definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to tour\/explore the island on their own.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The Shaka Kauai app added enormously to our time on Kauai. The tours are interesting,  informative, easy to follow and well produced. We enjoyed the tour of the North Shore so much we did the Waimea Canyon\/Na Pali Coast tour the next day.  Anyone planning to visit these areas should get these tours. Truly terrific.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great app. Very informative and entertaining. We saved a ton compared with a cruise ship excursion and our family thought this was probably better.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Shaka Guide was a great way to explore Kauai and the other Hawaiian islands. We enjoyed using the \u201cWaimea Canyon and Na Pali Coast\u201d tour during our stay in Kauai as it allowed us to travel and explore on our own time at our own pace. Shaka Guide was very informative and kept us entertained throughout the ride. My only two complaints were the slight downtime between stops (never drastically long, but nobody likes dead silence) and the fact that Shaka Guide started to repeat some of the highlights on the way back because of their location on the map (just a little too close). Overall, I would highly recommend Shaka Guide for your next adventure around the Hawaiian islands.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Played Ap through my iPad as rental car didn\u2019t allow media hookup. All could hear in three minivan rows. Download is a must as cell service doesn\u2019t exist. Bring a charger because lack of service and use of Ap eats battery. Directions are very clear. Recommendations are perfect. Hikes can be difficult and very muddy in Kaua\u2019i.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We\u2019ve been to Kaua\u2019i several times now.  We were going to travel to the north side and found this cool app that gave us a great tour, highlighting all the cool stops along the way and more importantly the great little stories about Kaua\u2019i along the way.  We had a local from Oahu with us on this drive and they were super impressed with all the cool stories.  I loved hearing about all the cool stops...even the driver my hubby was able to enjoy the tour!  For only $8 a tour, we will be purchasing more tours of the island for sure!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Informative go-at-own-pace tour.  Perfect directions, full of historical facts, folklore and stories.  Just a note that the suggested hikes take more time than estimated, especially due to slippery trail conditions.  Highly recommend at least sneakers, if not actual hiking boots, and find a good walking stick.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I so rarely pay for apps, but this one was worth it. We only took one of the tours, up to the Waimea Canyon. It worked perfectly! With two teens, impressing them (even in Kauai) can be challenging ;). They were grumpy at first but once we stopped at the Kauai Coffee Plantation they were all in. There was so much we wanted to share with them (my husband had been the first off island reporter after Iniki and I visited a year later) but our stories are \u2018so lame\u2019. \nThe voice talent is great and as soon as they asked a question it seems it was answered by the guide! \nMy only sadness is we are on the Big Island and excitedly downloaded that app. You only have one tour here! And due to the volcano of course it\u2019s closed. I was hoping for a Hilo and Saddleback road and maybe Kona area tours :( . Please keep up the good work! \nMaybe pair up with the Hawaii Uncovered tour book people - between the 2 apps all the info we needed was available!\nMahalo!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My wife and I were visiting Kauai the first time. We got quite at ease after first couple of way points. The rest of the drive, and most of the stops, was every entertaining and informative. No problem using the app to explore the island! Highly recommended for first time tourists!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Such an awesome way to see the canyon and Na Pali coast. Not only do you see all the best spots while the app configures GPS, but the stories and music teach you so much. We used both a Kawaii tour and a Maui tour and I\u2019m so happy to leave Hawaii feeling like I didn\u2019t just see the sights, but understand and learned the history in a fun way!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Enjoyed the tours at own speed. Can pass up stuff or stop as wish. The directions to turn while driving could be improved. But since on Island time and most locals low key, having to turn around sometimes no biggie","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Excellent guide well worth the $$\nI have 6 year old twins that I was worried may not be interested in the guide but I was wrong they loved it and asked for more. Will def buy the others when I visit the other islands","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Loved the Kauai Tour!  I did the North Shore tour today and can\u2019t wait to do the others during my week on Kauai.  The tour  was super entertaining and informative. The virtual guide took me places that I never would have seen on my own and not having to plan an itinerary is huge!!  There was an excellent balance between driving and short hikes. The turn by turn navigation is so helpful as is the narration...I feel like Iearned so much about the island than I ever would have had I went out on my own. Basically, I had a private tour guide for a small fraction of the cost an actual guide would have charged me!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The guide took us up to the canyon and told us all the places to stop to take pictures.  He told stories along the way too.  So glad we did it.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Worked well and found some of the coolest places in Kauai. Wouldn\u2019t have without Shaka app. I have used it Maui as well on road to Hana. Great app.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We decided to go on self-guided trips while visiting Hawaii and this app gave, by far, the best narrative and details of any we found. Waterfalls, history, canyons, points of interest\u2014its all there. \nThe mapping was point on, and always displayed turns and\/or locations with pinpoint accuracy. \nThe lighthearted jokes and puns in the narrative provided great laughs (and groans) and reinforced my rating of this app as SUPERB!! \nI look forward to returning to Hawaii and seeing some of the other trips we didn\u2019t have time for. \nMahalo! \u2018Til next time.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I used all three of the Kauai road tour apps.  Everyone was excellent and my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed visiting all the places they took us to.  From the beaches, some we would never have found without the apps, to the suspension bridges, canyons, rivers, waterfalls, quaint shops, restaurants, etc,   I highly recommend them to anyone.  We saw many more places than we could ever had hoped to if we did not have the downloaded apps.  Thank you SHAKA !   Peter Rich, Tennessee.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I purchased all three of the Kauai tours. We fully completed one in a very long day and partially did the other two. Well worth it to have an audio guide in the car to tour this island! We found some cool spots, witnessed beautiful sights, and learned quite a bit about the island and it\u2019s history. I highly recommend these tours. I can\u2019t wait to return to finish the Kauai tours we didn\u2019t complete and experience the Shaka Guides for other islands!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Amazing tour guide!! A MUST when visiting the islands. It\u2019s like taking a local boy in your car with you showing you the sites and learning the culture. Even my 10 yr old was into the stories. The stops were stop on. Learned some history of the islands. Great potty stops and food place suggestions. Funny too. Music was a bonus. Thanks so much for this tour. Please add more for Kauai.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We did all three tours on the Shaka guide and they were all awesome!! Very knowledgeable and found a bunch great spots we would have never known about!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"A friend recommended Shaka and I\u2019m SO glad we took a day to explore the Wimea Canyon\/Na Pali Coast Tour. The tour was honestly amazing, from the perfect prompting for turns and stops to the cool stories and history throughout the trip. It\u2019s totally yours to customize and make your own. Want to take a super long hike mid-tour? Go ahead and the guide will be waiting when you return. I loved that my husband and I could see the parts of the island without A.) being stuck in a van with a bunch of strangers and B.) paying a ton of money. Highly recommend!! And hope to see this guide expand to other locations beyond Hawaii!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Just buy it! We purchased both the canyon and north shore tours. We spent 1\/2 day doing the north shore tour (a part of the tour was closed due to flooding) and about 7 hours total with the canyon tour (took hikes and stopped for food too).  Couldn\u2019t have been more pleased. Between the history, music, suggested stops, food and jokes, we had a blast. It\u2019s as if you have a personal guide all day long. You truly can\u2019t go wrong.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"My family and I were greatly impressed with Shaka Guide Kauai. We used it this past week when visiting the beautiful island of Kauai. The guide pointed out several amazing stops that we would of simply missed if we drove around the island without the guide. The audio tour guide was very informative, entertaining, and overall enjoyable. It instructed us where great views were, which locations had restrooms, amazing places to stop for food, and periodically gave us an overview of the tour to keep a time frame in mind. Which was greatly appreciated, as myself and my family were required to get back on the cruise ship by a certain time. I would highly recommend using Shaka Guide. We\u2019re grateful we choose Shake Guide!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We have done 3 of the tours- two in Kaua\u2019i and one in Maui and feel like it enhanced our vacation and the memories we will take with us. Incredibly easy to use and entertaining. I would highly recommend purchasing the Shaka guides for whatever area\/island you are interested in exploring! 5 stars aren\u2019t even enough!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was a fun and efficient way to see a part of the island without driving the entire place. Parts history, activity and food to do all or pick and choose.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was a really fun way to explore the canyon drive and learn some Hawaiian history while at it! Way fun music and awesome info. I will definitely be purchasing other tours","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We originally used the Shaka guide on the road to Hana on Maui.  We spent a lot of money on that trip, and the most worthwhile purchase was the Shaka guide. Which is why we used it again for the Waimea canyon tour.  The only thing I would add is that some of the hikes could use more in depth description for difficulty and time (a \u201cquick hike\u201d turned into 3 hours and exhausted)","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was by far the best self driving tour I\u2019ve ever had. The history was great informative and to the point. Jokes were funny, directions accurate. I look forward to doing the next two tours offered here on Kauai!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My family and I had signed up for a tour that was cancelled last minute so we ended up with a whole day free. I found a flyer for this app at the Kauai Coffee company and decided to give it a try. We took the Waimea canyon tour. It was great. The tour included turn by turn directions, tons of useful information and great stories and legends about Kauai. I would love to take more of their tours if we have anymore free time.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Excellent narration with turn by turn directions to all the sites and stops along the way. From awesome views to little fruit stands, swimming, snorkeling and some history, this app covers a lot. If you want to get the most out of your trip, you won\u2019t be disappointed!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

We highly recommend these apps. We would love to have driving tours of all sorts of places such as this one.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Had guests with us who had never been to Kauai. They liked hearing about the history of stuff so downloaded the Waimea guide. Worked out well with the guide giving us accurate directions and giving us informative and entertaining info.  Made the drive go quickly.  Our guests loved it and to be truthful even though I\u2019ve been to Kauai many times I loved it as well and learned a lot about Kauai as well. Definitely recommend!  Downloading the Hanalei app for the next drive tour. For the price of a 2 scoops ice cream cone at lamperts $6, really worth it","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We heard about this app from other guests on the island & thought we\u2019d give it a try. We did the Weimea & N\u0101pali Tour on Kauai. This is a great way to experience various parts of the island. You can go at your own pace, stop when you want, explore at your leisure.  Although we have done this drive several times before on our own, we were able to see some great stuff with the Shaka Guide hat we hadn\u2019t seen before. The snippets of history, geography & all kinds of trivia keeps it very interesting in between stops. They\u2019ve even included some restroom stops. Make sure to allow plenty of time to complete the tour, don\u2019t forget your phone charger & connecting your phone through you car stereo is a definite plus for the enhanced audio.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Shaka app truly made our tour of Kauai more interesting as well as relaxing.  Huge perk was the aptly selected bits of music and historical information.  We also liked going off the main highways to some scenic spots.  Best investment for our trip!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My wife and I absolutely loved this self guided tour. We used this app on all the islands we visited and every single time was amazing. Would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a fun day of sight seeing and hiking.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Good app but a little disappointed that you have to buy the island tour in separate tours. The app that we used in Maui gave the whole island for one price. I did like the music on this app though - nice touch.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"We very rarely pay for an app, but on a whim we tried Shaka\u2019s Road to Hana tour on Maui.  We were hooked! It really is like having a tour guide in your car, one that is both entertaining and informative.  The app worked well for us, used our phone GPS instead of data, and provided helpful options to preview and review the tour.  We ended up buying their tours for everywhere we went\u2014Haleakal\u0101, Kauai\u2019s Waimea Canyon and North Shore, and the Big Island\u2019s Volcanoes National Park.  We tried the competitor app (GyPSy) for circling the Big Island and found it dry and not as user-friendly.  Shaka is WAY better. Can\u2019t say enough about the Shaka tours. Enthusiastically recommend!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is the first time I have used a driving tour app and I am so impressed. The best part is the built in GPS and guide that give great directions and give you plenty of time to make turns, etc. I love the suggestions for places to stop for snacks, lunch, and shopping. It has been so nice to tour on our own while vacationing, yet feel like we have a tour guide right there in the car with us. It has given us more confidence to travel on our own. And we will definitely use this app again. Very easy to use!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We\u2019ve been on the Kauai for 3 days - and unfortunately have had a lot of rain! Not the kind of weather to sit by the pool or beach and relax... so we decide to get out and explore. I googled Kauai driving map and stumbled on this app and decided to check it out. We figured it was worth trying to go to another area of the island looking for some sun - and if no sun was to be found at least we were out seeing something new! What a great decision. We\u2019ve now done all 3 Kauai tours and it\u2019s been the best part of our vacation. The tours are fun, informative, and include great little stops that we would have never found had we not taken the tour. Tours are easy to follow with great and detailed spoken instructions. Even little tips like \u2018pull over here and look for someplace to park - because if you go farther down the road it\u2019s difficult to turn around.\u2019 The tour guide is funny and engaging - sharing a great amount of history and interesting anecdotes as you follow the route. I highly recommend investing the minimal cost to purchase the tours - all 3 have been great!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We enjoyed the stories, music and sights! We saw things we would not have without the app! Thank you!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We really enjoyed this tour. A little hokey in places but entertaining. Our daughter and son-in-law recommended we use these tours and we have wen pleased. Have used 2 all ready and will use the 3rd. The tours us places even our friends who have been coming here for years haven\u2019t heard of. Well worth the money.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We stumbled upon this app through a Google search. After reading the reviews, we decided to download and use it as our primary tool for exploring Kauai. This app is excellent. As others have said, it feels as though you have a private tour guide in your car. The app uses GPS to detect your location and, based on that, gives you a spot on narrative of that location. The guide also shows you the best places to pull over to check out the amazing views. You can also pause the app and spend as much or little time in each location as you want without missing a beat. I strongly recommend this app to anybody considering exploring the island. Don\u2019t bother booking a guided tour; rent a car and tour the island with this app \u2014 you will have a much better experience (and save a lot of money).","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Me and my Wife downloaded this hoping we would get some insight on our way up to the Waimea Canyon. It delivered more than just pointing out facts..it entertained us and really got us in to the Aloha spirit and made us feel like we had our own personal guide with us. Download the tour app before you go, it\u2019ll make it so much easier in the event you lose reception, which you will! The interface is easy, user friendly and when we didn\u2019t stop at a key point of interest, it just moved on to the next one coming up. Love this app.. we\u2019d do all the guided tours if we had more time or found it earlier!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We bought two. Wailua Falls and napali. Both were absolutely necessary for our tour. But narrator was corny to a fault and this got old. He also talked down to us. We missed a few turns where instructions weren\u2019t clear","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"We loved the tours! They were interesting and made our experience way better than if we were just on our own. We were able to enjoy the views and not stress about maps and directions! We did the wimea canyon and north shore tours","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"What a wonderful find!! It was cloudy and a bit rainy for most of our time in Kauai, so we did a lot more driving around than beach hanging, and boy did this app come in handy!! We did almost every tour and enjoyed learning about the history and secret spots on Kauai we would have overlooked. The guide also instructed you on the road etiquette in some places, which was extremely helpful. I highly recommend the Shaka guide to anyone visiting the islands! FIVE STARS!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We use the Shaka guide for both the Waimea Canyon and the North Shore.   \nIt had great stories, corny jokes and terrific directions. Just be aware that you have to drive to the starting point for the app to start.  \nFor example:  We rented a car at the airport and had to drive for a bit for for the app to start.  Pay attention to the pop up directions when you turn the app on on where to drive to.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

Would definitely use again if we\u2019re lucky enough to go back to the islands!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We have been up the canyon several times over several visits to the island, but this made the trip fun and interesting. We found things and view points we missed previously.  The stories were great and provided insight and history. We couldn\u2019t wait to get back to the car to continue the journey.  A true five star app, Worth every penny!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We discovered the Shaka apps quite by accident   A nice young couple at the car rental desk told us about them & we are so glad they did!!   We used 2 of the tours on Maui & 2 on Kauai.

Mahalo Shaka!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"$5.00 for a guided tour!!! Great directions! Fun facts! Saw places we would never have found on our own!! Highly recommended!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I am an Uber driver on Kaua\u2019i. I love telling visitors about our island. One rider told me about this app and I was hooked! I thought I knew a lot about the island but after hearing these apps I learned so much more! It is fun do for new and old visitors to hear the music, stories, and local talk. I have had some visitors ask me to take them on the other tours. I have even booked a date with my wife to do the tours! Whee Bra, dat ono Aloha!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Our first trip to Kauai and we only had one full day there. The app was wonderful. Taking us to places we would have never found. Giving us background and historical info Along the way. The little tips like where the mini marts are, this beach has (or doesn\u2019t have) restrooms, how locals navigate a one lane bridge and even where to park. Turn by turn directions were great and up to date. The history was interesting and the music helped set the proper mood.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Absolutely one of the most useful apps I have ever used. We toured both Oahu and Kauai using the Shaka Guide and experienced\/learned so much about the islands. Highly recommend!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We loved the Shaka Guide! It was great having a guide to point us to all the best spots and give us the backstory to make it even more interesting. Totally worth the cost of the downloads. We are sad that there isn\u2019t a Shaka Guide back on the main land.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app totally made our Hawaii trip. It guided us on the road and took us to some super cool spots that we would never have known of. We had such an amazing day filled with activities and fun stories from the app. So happy we were recommended this!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Spot on with GPS! Works great, like you have your own tour guide in the car! Love the historical background!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Informative and often goofy, served up with a side of cheese.  It made us giggle and the stories were interesting.  We skipped sections but we enjoyed ourselves.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"For $5, it\u2019s worth it to learn some interesting facts about Kauai, but biggest value comes from them showing you where to stop & turn off for different hikes.  Hikes are WAY better than just driving tours.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"My family and I loved everything about this guide! It was so easy to use and it was easy to skip parts of the tour if we weren\u2019t interested. My only complaint is that the whole app was 4.99 and not each tour inside. Still worth it!!\n\nEditing because I don\u2019t know how to respond to the developers comment. I realize now that my review didn\u2019t make sense so that\u2019s my bad! I meant to say that I wish the app was $4.99 up front (for the whole thing) instead of paying 4.99 for each tour. Paying for each tour makes the app over $15, which is pricey, in my opinion for an app, especially since that\u2019s just for one island! If there\u2019s a way to make it cheaper, please let me know! I recommend this app for the info, but downloading the (free) app and then being surprised with paying for each tour, isn\u2019t fun. Maybe if the app for the whole state of Hawaii was $15, then I\u2019d understand.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"We completed the driving tour today. Loved the price and loved that you could go at your own pace. Lots of fun facts and stories to keep you entertained along the way. Just downloaded the next one to take tomorrow and am really excited for the tour.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great narrative and well worth the money! Only thing that would have made it better would be more music on the way up between talking points!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is a fantastic app! The narration is on point and took us t some beautiful places on the island.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"To get to enjoy the full experience I recommend getting started a little earlier in the day. We began the North Shore tour from Kapa\u2019a around 2pm and returned about 6pm. But great music and stories, I loved learning so much about the island history. Mahalo!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was fun at the same time being informative. Went to places even the concierge at the hotel didn\u2019t know about. Made our vacation well within our budget. I just wish they would do states In the continental  US","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Very helpful and entertaining . We spent the majority of our day following \nvery clear  and specific directions to some unbelievable places that would not have been easy to find on our own !","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was totally fun and enjoyable.  We came here in January and it rained the first day.  Taking the waterfall tour during the rainy weather, made for a great day.  The music and jokes, stories - both legend and factual - made up for the weather.  This is pure fun - no disrespect intended as one person rating the app implied.  The GPS was an excellent way to navigate the island.  One navigational error in the North Shore tour: 68, wet cave, said it was on the right.  It\u2019s actually in the left about 15 yards prior where stated.  Well worth the investment.  We would never have found many places for they are not well marked.  Kudos\nOne thing of interest when doing the Canyon \/ NaPali tour - wear a bathing suit if you hike to the waterfall.  I was disappointed that I didn\u2019t know I could wade in the waterfall.  Also, if you have trekking poles, take them.  Absolutely entertaining and fun to follow.\nThis was such a good app, that I had 5 other friends download it for our trip.  The app is first class!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Really enjoyed the history. The only issues are that the map is sometimes not totally clear, mainly when looking for the start, and once in a blue moon the narration stopped during a description. It's a tough technical problem to get prefect, so these are only minor points. \n\nDefinitely worth the low price. We took all three tours of Kauai.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I am blown away at how well made this app is. We used Shaka Guide for the Napali coast on Kauai and Road to Hana on Maui. We had the BEST days ever following this guide and tour. Love it and will recommend to other travelers.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Best way to improve your short time in Hawaii!!! We have all used the guidebooks and prefer this app. Used on maui and now Kauai. Thanks Shaka guide","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"A lone travelers best friend, I liked that it even told u when to pull over and park! The stories along the way were fun too.  The left turns on the Na Pali Tour after the coffee company came too quickly though!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We had a ton of fun, even my teenage kids thought it was fun. So many things we would have missed if we didn\u2019t do the tour. Lots of Gems. Can\u2019t wait for the road to Hana next week. \ud83e\udd19","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"First time using Shaka guides in Hawaii. First time on Kauai. I had downloaded the Waimea Canyon tour prior to arrival to Kauai. Enjoyed it so much then downloaded the North Shore Kauai tour trip for another fabulous adventure. The guide provides so much information and enjoyment for car rides. Technically worked so well. Had us every step of the way!  I wish all apps and technology worked so well!  Don\u2019t hesitate to download and use it. I felt it lessened the car trip stress- no fighting over directions, no back seat drivers - set it and go and see the all the fabulous spots that Hawaii has to offer.  Don\u2019t forget to bring a phone car charger to keep it going!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Picked up this app while looking for a different one, right before a day trip to Kauai\u2019s North Shore. We had a tentative plan, but this was so much better. Turn by turn guide starts in Kapa\u2019a and ends at Ke\u2019e beach, but you can start at any point on that path. We were taken to hidden, off the beaten path locations with ease, while being entertained and educated. Take as much time as you like at each point of interest. Picks up where you left off. GPS triggers worked very, very accurately except maybe at the very last part near Ke\u2019e. So much fun! I only wish we had started earlier-we started ours around noon. Each of the 3 tours - Waimea Canyon, Wailua and North shire, requires an additional $4.99 (as of the date of this review) in-app purchase. So worth it! Thanks Shaka for the great afternoon.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Much of the sites on Kauai I had seen before, however, it was very nice having some history and stories. Also great finding little hidden things that are not talked about so much like the bridges in Waimea. Can\u2019t wait to do the tours on the other islands.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is amazing! I decided to go out to the north shore from Kapa\u2019a today but I wanted to get a feel for the island. This app was perfect. The guide tells you where the best spots are for eating, swimming and hiking. He also tells you some of the stories and legends about the island. More than worth it.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The Shaka guide app was a wonderful addition to our Kaua\u2018i vacation. We toured the entire island, went on many beautiful hikes, saw spectacular views and ate at local food stops that were fun and delicious. We would highly recommend this app for self directed folks who don\u2019t want to miss out on all that Kaua\u2018i has to offer. The history and Hawaiian folk tales were a bonus that made some of the long drives very enjoyable.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"If you are visiting a Hawaiian island, get the Shaka Guide for it. \n\nI\u2019ve visited 3 Hawaiian islands with my wife and done Shaka tours on all 3 of them - those days are easily highlights in our vacation!\n\nShaka Guides are exceptional. The very thoughtful design never leaves you wondering where to go. Audio queues are on point and very explanatory. The delivery is exceptional - the voice guiding you along the way is friendly, warm, educational and fun. But most importantly, the content is top notch!! I love the Hawaiian legends and cultural tidbits as much as the scientific explanations - exactly what I want from a tour guide. \n\nThe Kauai guide has tours all over the island. Once you do just 2 of them, you will feel like you know Kauai inside and out. I feel this is the best compliment for any tour guide. From hidden beaches to the best hikes, this is a great source for how to enjoy your time on the island. \n\nOf course, it helps that Kauai is incredibly beautiful - IF you know where to go ;)","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was so great for our last full day in Kauai when the weather wasn\u2019t that great and our boat tour got canceled. Best $5 we spent all trip. Can\u2019t wait to do the Road to Hana one in Maui this week.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is our first trip to Kaua\u2019i so we wanted to make the most of each day here. This guide was so helpful & we were able to see so much of the island with great narration, info on parking, bathroom stops, food reconditioned & we got to see many out of the way places we would have never found in our own. We loved the option to either stop or keep the on going and the guide picked right back up where we were. And the price is worth way more then $4.99!! Very best deal of our entire trip!! I highly recommend this app for first time visitors or those who want a perfect guided tour. \nCan\u2019t wait to use all 3 of the tours this week!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app works as advertised and it will take you places you normally wouldn\u2019t know about. Also, the stories and insider information are excellent. The narration is great and easy to listen to. Don\u2019t hesitate to get it.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We bought this app on a whim as we started our vacation in Kauai.  It turned out to be the best purchase of the week. We did all three driving tours. Each time, Shaka showed us off the beaten path sites and activities that we would not have otherwise known about. All were interesting and fun. \nOur only issue with the recommendations was that hikes were rated as being less strenuous than a average American would find them to actually be. The payoff was usually worth the effort, but be warned: easy is really moderate, moderate is strenuous and strenuous means you should be an experienced in shape hiker. The offline maps worked great, especially since a lot of the areas are not well covered with cellular service. \nThanks Shaka for making our trip extra special. (No more coconut jokes though)","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We are really enjoying our private tour of the island. Great music and history lessons.  We had trouble connecting to the car stereo but the FAQ helped.  Can\u2019t wait to go on the next tour.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"This app is awful. It took us to various parking lots while telling terrible jokes. We gave up after the third parking lot and just google mapped sites.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"My wife and I were impressed at how much we enjoyed the guided tour.  It was very accurate and helpful,  sharing all the little hidden jems\/hikes that we would had otherwise drove right by.  We downloaded all three, one for each day.  I think the days of the in-person tour guide are numbered with this sort of innovation.   Very cost effective! Shaka!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We did all three tours and just loved them.  Not only do you see all the sites Kauai has to offer with few exceptions, the narrator is funny and informative.  You\u2019ll not only learn about the sites but he tells you great stories of the past while driving to the next spot.  You will learn ancient Hawaii stories, history and hear some great music along the way.  Wish it covered the south coast","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"We enjoyed the stories along the way, and surely would have missed some hidden spots if it wasn\u2019t for the great guidance and turn by turn directions. The nice thing is when you choose to skip a stop, he moves right on to the next one! Definitely with the small investment!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This a great app! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed touring Kauai with the Shaka App as our guide.  Loved the history, the great tips, suggestions, the music and the great sense of humor of the guide. I highly recommend this app! If this is your first visit to Kauai, don\u2019t waste any more time and buy all three Kauai apps. You won\u2019t be sorry!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I can't even imagine what we would have missed out on if we hadn't purchased this app. This was the most amazing vacation! Our time spent exploring was so awesome with the easy directions, tips, and stories along the way! We were able to find places that we wouldn't have been able to locate otherwise. It allowed us to sit back and relax without constantly having to refer to the book. I plan to buy the apps when I visit other Hawaiian islands. Almost everything mentioned on the app was worth the stop along the way!!!!! Thank you for creating this app. We had the time of our life!!!!!! We plan to visit a lot of the beaches next time and do more hiking at some of the locations that we stopped at on the tours.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was very ho-hum. I felt like the target market was mid-westerners. To speak of the Mighty Plantation Era and refer to it in some sort of reverence, isn't necessary. You can tell history without it being favourable. Especially when it is not for a lot of society; and if it's complex- explain it. The GPS guide is great.. but other apps do the same. This was too geared to people ignorant of history, and those who haven't got the basics of the place yet. It takes a swift trip through a lonely planet guide book or the Kauai museum in Lihue, to get an accurate picture of the island and not to tolerate this syrupy and particularly lame account of a very very interesting place. The details of which were lost here. I so wished it was better!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app was recommended to us by a family friend and we were impressed with how much we learned about Kauai just based on this driving tour.  To note, the tour doesn't just point out interesting locations, but encourages users to get out of their vehicle and visit the spots.\n\nWould recommend!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Fun history and guide to locations through out the island. Wouldn't have found half of the locations that we did without the app. Worth the purchases of all three guides. The guide is fun to listen too. Love the fun history facts info as you drive along. I give it two thumbs up.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is a must have if you want to really see all the beauty of this wonderful island. You will absolutely love this!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Wonderful tour! We loved all the stories that the guide shared along the way. There were a couple of times the turns came up on us before the guide had really prepared us for them but for the most part he directed us well. If you follow the map while you listen for directions that helps. We did get eaten alive on the hikes. I think mostly it was the wailua falls area tour hikes that had all the mosquitoes. Bring bug spray!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"What a great way to explore Hawaii for the first time! The guide worked flawlessly as it was well synchronized and provide interesting stories during the drive. It was convenient as we could choose where and how many times to stop based on our time schedule. My kids loved listening to the stories in the car although some were a bit graphic and probably more appropriate for 10+.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We had heard about the app while reviewing trip advisor.....best review I ever read....since I decided to download the app! We used it twice while on the island and were pleasantly surprised and overjoyed with the information, the stories and the detailed turn by turn instructions.  It is too bad I didn't know about this app when we visited Maui and Oahu.....I would recommend it to anyone looking to do their own driving tour while visiting the islands!!!! Enjoy and Mahalo Bra.....","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We used the Shaka Guide today on our way to the Waimea Canyon and it was so helpful! It's like having your own personal tour guide in your car, telling interesting stories and guiding you the whole way. What an awesome idea...can't recommend highly enough!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is our 2nd time to Kauai and we wanted to see things we weren't able to the first time. We were amazed at all things we had missed and cool stories that we learned along the way. Buy it you will not regret it!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"After using Shaka Guide's excellent Road to Hana tour in Maui, I was excited to give the Kauai tours a try as well.  It did not disappoint!  The tour stops are interesting and beautiful. Many of them are \"tried and true\" tourist locations, but there are some great ones that are off the beaten path as well. We found ourselves standing on a gorgeous beach completely alone at one point. It was magical!\nIn addition, I had a little difficulty downloading one of the tours (bad wifi connection), so I called for tech support. Even though it was a Sunday ( a day they are off business hours) someone called me back within 10 mins to make sure I got it sorted out. I was impressed!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This guide was awesome, we saw so many parts of Kauai that we would have missed with this app. I usually map out our vacations using travel books prior, and the Shaka guide had so much more than the books with all the hidden gems. We loved hearing all about the island's history, legends, and culture. Our kids loved it too, my son wanted to hear \"the guide\" tell us about California when we got home.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We loved this tour and the Maui Road to Hana!! I felt like I was with a local the whole time. This app really made our trip so much more enriched  with fun stories and music. Thank you!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is the best guided tour we've had!  Length of tour and sights were perfect. Scenery was amazing and we never would have thought to go to get poke at the store we went to for lunch without the suggestion so that's a plus. Also the history was great while driving. Learned some pretty cool stuff on the way. Chaka!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We thoroughly enjoyed having this personal tour guide in our car!  Used it in both Maui & Kauai.  Well worth the money. Saw and experienced things I never knew about in all my other visits to these islands!  Thanks \"bra\"....this app is awrsome!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We really enjoyed using this app. Our last day in Kauai we had hours to kill and decided to go on the canyon drive. It was amazing and we learned a ton of cool stuff along the way. I would recommend for your trip in Kauai but make sure to do more and Check it out early on your trip. Way cheaper then booking on a crappy bus tour","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I had a tour booked for Kauai. One that picks you up from your Waikiki hotel insanely early, flies to another island and returns you at the end. Well while at the airport flight gets cancelled so no tour. We decide to book another flight on another airline to Kauai, rent a car and blindly drive around the island. I got this tour and we loved it. Such a better experience than we would have done. Hidden gems, roadside treats.  We enjoyed it so much we got it for Oahu as well even though we'd been there 4 days already. \n\nMy only suggestion for improvement- I wish I could select more music. They have some Hawaiian music on here but sometimes it was 20 min to stop 1 or traffic made it a while between numbers. I would have loved to have it continue to play music since its using the cars speakers.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was the best thing I purchased prior to coming to Kauai! There is so much to see and do here that it can be overwhelming. To maximize your time and truly enjoy Kauai to the fullest this app is a must have. We enjoyed everything it had to offer from the stories of Hawaiian culture, to the \"off the beaten path\" beaches and views, to the amazing food recommendations! It's a great tour companion. We liked that you can set your own pace, and even start and stop whenever you like! We loved the North Shore and Waimea tour so much we ended up buying the 3rd one. Plan to spend a whole day with each tour at least. Only recommendation we have would be to make more tours of Kauai! Maybe smaller versions or other areas that aren't included currently. Thanks Shaka guide! You really made our trip memorable!!!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We were in Honolulu and purchased a relatively expensive bus tour and thought it was mediocre at best. Not wanting to make the same mistake twice in Kaui, we simply rented a car, downloaded this amazing app, and saved nearly $150 by using the Shaka app. It took us to all of the must see dots on the north shore. It was efficient and effective. I'm extremely satisfied!!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Wow. This app is wonderful!  The narrative is very informative and helpful. It walks you through places you'd probably miss with big tours. I can't wait to use it again tomorrow to explore more. Excellent job!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was better than being herded around on a tour bus.  We used the North Shore and Waimea Canyon apps.  Couldn't squeeze in the Waterfalls tour because we went to Big Island.  I thought the directions were good and I enjoyed the history.  The narrator got a little goofy at times but you just laugh it off.  Do not do the Volcano National Park on the Big Island without the Big Isle Shaka app.  It was fantastic!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I bought guides for Waimea & NaPali Coast and the North Shore. My daughter and I really enjoyed the detailed driving instructions, local information, narratives, and music. I highly recommend these travel guides.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I found this on the internet and decided to give it a try. Hardly costs anything and was perfect for our self exploring needs. No reason to take an expensive tour if you have a car. Informative and efficient. Try it!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"It was great to drive around the island knowing that I wouldn't miss any big or small hot spot. I loved the many tales of the island folklore and the guild even tell you a few Hawaiian words. It was great!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We used the tour for our day trip to Waimea Canyon. The app added fun and interesting info to our trip. Thanks!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My husband and I were able to see so many sights with this app. With our guide narrating our turn by turn directions we could both relax and enjoy the scenery instead of one of us huddled over a guide book. Highly recommended!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Our concierge recommended this app and I'm glad we grabbed it and downloaded the tours. We have two teenagers and it totally engaged them as we drove Waimea and the North Shore. It can be a little corny at times, but that's part of the charm. Definitely grab this if you are touring Kauai!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"You need need to get this app for your tour (s) of the Hawaiian islands. Very helpful and very informative and follows the GPS coordinates so you never miss a moment to find a secret beach or hidden waterfall. \n\nMahalo to the Shaka Guide! Aloha!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We did the Waimea and Na Pali Tour. It was the best day we had in Kauai. The app worked so much better than we ever thought. The tour was really cool, it told us the history of the island and all sorts of other information. The views it took us to were breathtaking. The food was ever better. We absolutely loved every second of it! One thing to note is that some of the hikes are \"moderate\" but we are avid hikers and they were pretty challenging!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great app, especially for first time visitors. There's so much to do and see on this island, it's overwhelming. This app makes it manageable and fun. It guides you to the best views and some fun, off the beaten path stuff we never would have found on our own. Love it!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We found this app after desperately searching info on google. Our airline got us here late so had to cut our vacation from 7 days of sightseeing into 5. The guide was entertaining and informative. We found sights we would never have found otherwise. The GPS feature and accompanying narrative worked flawlessly so we were never lost or confused. \n\nI wish there was more music in between points so my iPhone wouldn't repeatedly start the first song on my phone every time we hit a lull.\n\nWe can't wait to try another Kauai Shaka Tour later this week! Thank you for enriching our time here!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

This was the best money i have spent on the entire vacation !!\n\nMahalo!!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"If not for this app I probably wouldn't have ventured far from the resort. A friend recommended that we get the app and that it was well worth the five dollars. \n\nI would have to agree with them wholeheartedly. The app was great, the jokes not so much. Directions where for the most part very good.  Though, it probably couldn't keep up with the speed I drive. So I would recommend driving the speed limit if you can. \n\nThe hikes were wonderful and the stops beautiful and will be buying another tour.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is a great app when you visit this island!   Much culture, history, music, and directions -- all without using data.  Turn your navigation system off and use Shaka instead!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I'll have to say, as kama'aina, this app was pretty decent to use on Kauai (I also have the Oahu one ).  My 8 year old loved the music (from \"Lilo & Stitch\" & \"Moana\") & getting a little bit of Hawaiian history (King Kamehameha & King Kaumuali'i) ... it was good for days where we were like \"Should we drive around?  Yeah!\"  \ud83d\ude0a\n\nMy only issue is wanting music or more information during the \"dead space\" - it would make it more interesting to sing along to music about that area (e.g. my daughter, husband & I loved singing \"Koke'e\" on the drive down from Wai'ale'ale \ud83c\udfa4\n\nI hope you will be able to do part of a tour or extend it in Poipu ... can talk story about the tunnel of trees, blowhole, etc., as it is a 6 mile drive that you can talk through as well.  Mahalo for making the ride enjoyable!  \ud83c\udf3a","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"We only had one day on Kauai and decided the best way to use that day was to drive as much of the island as we could. This app made our entire day! With off the beaten path beaches to best places to eat, we would have missed so much if it weren't for this app. Unlike other \"island drives,\" this app shares the aloha of the islands and brings the culture and history right into your front seat. We met people who were using the same app and it was awesome!! Thank you so much for having something that made our brief visit meaningful. \n\nWe plan on trying the Oahu guide a go. We are there all of the time but figure we are probably missing something!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"We are so happy that we brought this app to spend our time in Hawaii. It saved several hours of research to find out sightseeing places. App neatly arranged all the location so that there is no back and forth from one place to other. We maximized number of places and it helped to understand history behind each location. Our kinds learned a lot about Hawaiian history legends, music, customs, etc. In short this app made our trip one of best experience.\n \nThis app may seem expensive but it's really worth for every penny.\n \nWe experienced couple of technical glitches and customer support is awesome.\n\nWe love narrator. Keep producing quality app like this for other key locations in US.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Thank you so much for an incredible tour of Kauai.  Spent our first day lost and frustrated. Downloaded your app and spent the next day having the best time ever and seeing everything!!!!  DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Really liked the tour, going to use another later this week.  If I were to change anything it would be a little better interaction with the narrative that allowed you to skip over stops and also could include\/exclude things like food or shopping from the steps.  Also missing a turn didn't redirect you back in line with the tour. All that said, those are nit picky and also part of the download and offline only requirements so they're not complaints.  Fact is we had a great tour, a great time, will totally recommend and will use again.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This tour was fantastically developed, insightful and easy to use. Go at your own pace through each stop or skip anything you like. The history in between each stop is also really helpful. Absolutely no need to spend on a guided tour company. Shaka does it better and let's you be in control!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We used both the north & south driving tours for our Kauai trip. While at first the narrator seemed a little goofy, we grew to appreciate how much care is put into blending history, local lore, and music to make an entertaining tour. We even re-visited a few spots because the audio was so informative. Only request is to give more advance warning for turns so we don't have to u-turn so often. And I wish I'd found out earlier that we could play each stop on demand, regardless of location... only stumbled onto that at the end. Overall an excellent value & great way to meet the island.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"So helpful and informative!\nWe drove up the North Coast and the Shaka app helped point out great place to stop and see,as well as providing history\/humor along the way","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Took the North Shore tour today, and loved it enough to buy the Waimea Canyon tour tomorrow!  Would have taken hours if not Days to find all these places to go, plan it, and hit all the highlights.  This made it easy, but allowed us to go our own pace, spending time how we wanted too. More time at some beaches, less at others; shopping here and skipping past there. The information was great, and the jokes...well, some were funny, some corny, but you could\nLaugh at all for different reasons!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"These tours have been nothing but wonderful for our first trip to Hawaii! My husband and I both agree that purchasing these tours (we bought 3\ndifferent tours for Maui and Kauai) was one of the best decisions we made this trip. We felt calm and relaxed knowing that our tour guide would show us where the best places to stop were. Our vacation was as wonderful as it was because we used these tours. Truly! I highly, highly recommend Shaka!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"commentary would only play for a few minutes and then would freeze up. We had to keep restarting the app. It was a pain. We finally gave up.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I toured 3 islands; Maui, Kauai and Oahu and this app was the best thing I could have asked for.  The tour is informative, fun and very detailed.  We saw things we would have never known about!  It works perfectly, tells you exactly where to go, where to stop, eat and even where there are public restrooms.  DON'T HESITATE, BUY IT!  Kudos to the app makers for creating such a wonderful app!  Worth every penny!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We toured both sides of the island with this app and enjoyed every minute of it. We saw sights that we normally wouldn't have seen while learning the history and stories surrounding them.  The turn by turn navigation was easy and convenient and spot on. \n\nThe only negative we can report is the area by the Swinging Bridge\/Menehune Ditch. We would've enjoyed looking around but the large homeless camp and sketchy locals hanging out in the parking area watching our every move made us very uncomfortable (plus we heard noises like something was being killed) so we beat feet out of there!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is the way to go to see The island. It was fun and interesting. I couldn't be happier how this worked as our own tour guide.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Definitely worth the money if you've never been to Kauai before. Or even if you have!lime another reviewer said, it's like having a tour guide riding around with you. Only (very minor) issues were sometimes it told me to turn a little later than needed. Also, isn't the \"Wet Cave\" on the left, not the right?  I would buy an app like this for any place I went on vacation if it was offered.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Our family of 6 (ages 8-72) just returned from a 10 day Kaua'i trip and used this app virtually every single day!!! We spent one whole Sunday strolling the south shore following every stop the app suggested. Our sons (8&11) begged for the app daily and can now recite legends and stories they heard on our vacation. My 72 year old father in law was stunned that this app too us to sites and beaches his \"trusty\" guide book didn't even feature. By day 3, he tossed his island guide book to the side and relied on our app.  \nDon't hesitate for a second! Don't purchase a tour guide. This app is hands down THE GREATEST!!!!!!!!

{"body":"This was our first trip to Kauai and we had no way to know how to see the most efficiently in a week. The professionalism is evident. This was thought through with wit and humor. We loved both tours and feel we had a much better time here because of this app. He still left plenty of room to let us discover things on our own too. Very nice. And I definitely want to come back to do more. This in tandem with the printed guide is all you need to have an amazing trip regardless of what you like to do.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was great my wife and I loved the stories. Everything about this app is top notch, would highly recommend to everyone.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"If you like listening to a tour guide rather than looking at a map, this is for you. Like having a friend ride along.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"As first timers to Kauai, we didn't feel compelled to read books and gather data for our exploration of the island. I stumbled across this app and decided to give it a try. What a pleasant surprise!  It was so informative, fun and helpful. It made navigating around the island so easy and we likely saw things we would have otherwise driven right by. Nice job, Shaka!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Loved the App\nGot us to and from our destination with great places to see.\nIt was entertaining and educational.\nIf traveling coast of Kauai a perfect tool.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We thoroughly enjoyed this app on our trip to Kauai. It's a must get!\n\nWe already planned to use our rental car to see the island, so this app was a perfect fit for us since it provided not only a planned tour with GPS navigation, but was very entertaining and informative with a wonderful mix of humor and education. It also provided quality local music and TV\/movie soundtracks to fit the locations. \n\nThe tours are self-paced and you can easily skip parts you may not be up to doing or have the time to do. It took us to places we wouldn't have found on our own. Plus we loved how it tells you the backstory\/history of each area you're traveling through. \n\nBoth the north and west tours were cheap and well worth it compared to the cost, crowds, and strict time schedules associated with guided group tours. \n\nI highly recommend this app. It really helped make our vacation fun!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Stumbled upon this app by chance and took the Waimea Canyon and Koke'e and Na Pali coast tour. We couldn't have spent the day any better. Great instructions, well thought out and great embellishing stories and music to capture our attention, incl our 5 year old's. We don't like bus tours - too much group, too much shepherding, too little time for quiet reflection. This intuitive app is excellent value for money. Mahalo nui loa.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We enjoyed listening to the tour around the north side of Kauai. It is much more relaxing to listen to the narrator tell you where to turn out for good views than continually looking at a map. Took a suggested hike with an amazing view we wouldn't have known about otherwise.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Taking our time, my husband and I spent about 10 hours exploring the many sights, hikes, towns and photo opportunities provided along the route. Each point along the way is a great experience! We would highly recommend this driving tour to anyone! Truly the best part of the tour is you can go at your own pace, see what you like or simply skip if you choose, explore how you want and still enjoy a wonderful experience! The Guide is very interesting and entertaining as well!\n\nThank you Shaka Guide","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Had a 1.5 day stop on Kauai last week while on a Norwegian cruise. We had a rental car, but hadn't really planned our itinerary in advance. I saw this app advertised in a magazine we got at the Hertz rental car location, so decided to take a gamble, download and give it a try. The app was wonderful. We followed its guided tour around the island and it took us to some great places we would never have known to visit. Using your phone GPS, it tells you where the next stops are and provides guidance where to turn. The narrator gave some very interesting facts (and often humorous) about different places on the island. The app was definitely worth the price. Highly recommend.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Saved us money and time.\nVery helpful and interesting.\nAlso gave us more freedom than having a tour guide.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"A must have to make the most of your time on Kauai and see all of the highlights plus off the beaten path sights\/points of interest. The narration and fun facts were interesting and informative too.  We spent the full day touring the Waimea Canyon and found some great hikes and food spots to return to that we might otherwise have missed. Planning to buy the North Coast guide next. We toured the North Coast already but are sure we missed some not to be missed great sites not to mention information\/fun facts. Buy it - you will love it.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Informational, fun and easy to follow, this app guided us along the north shore of Kauai. Yes, a little cheesy, but that only added to the app's appeal. There were many places we would never have looked for except for the information given here. This is well worth the price!  Adding more music might be nice!  Thanks.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is a great tool for finding out of the way sights and great hikes. Everyone we had in the car loved the informative and entertaining stories.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"We enjoyed the Waimea Canton drive and tour.  It was the first time we had tried a car audio tour like this - with two teenager girls no less.  We all enjoyed the audio tour and the tips and recommended stops.  We did 2 of the 3 recommended hikes and most of the stops - taking most of our day.  It was great!  It combines scenic sites, with history, with interesting facts and great tips to get most of your visit\/tour.  The GPS worked flawlessly and naturally prompted turns or highlights (cool way to use technology!). We look forward to our next Shaka tour!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is the first trip to Kauai for my wife and I. I found the app by doing a Google search. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did. The app\/guide works perfectly, automatically sensing where you are and playing the accompanying audio. We discovered some amazing beaches and other places that we never would have seen otherwise. The guide is PACKED with fun facts and suggestions. The one-lane bridge etiquette and Shaka sign are just a couple of examples. My wife and I took the North Shore tour yesterday and it took us most of the day. You could easily spend 3-4 days doing everything on the list for both Kauai tours. Well-worth the money.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I was lucky to find the App through a Google search. The technology worked extremely well. We learned tons about the Island, but did so at our pace and on our time. I give this Appmy highest recommendation. It is the wave of the future.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was awesome, worth all 499 pennies. It made our vacation great. We saw some places we would have never seen otherwise. We learned about the island and Hawaiian culture and colonization of the island. Buy both apps North Shore and West Coast.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Loved the GPS based prompts as well as the stories as we went. Fun stuff! Would have gotten 5 stars but I'd love it if there was more local music between stops and if pausing didn't make the app lose its place.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"This app is essential for exploring the island and gives history and colorful stories while driving from spot to spot. Excellent guide that took us to amazing, pristine, quiet beaches along the north shore as well as beautiful viewpoints and hikes along Waimea. Works without GPS when service is spotty. This was a must have for our adventures in Kauai.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The app worked pretty well and we definitely saw some beaches and heard some stories we wouldn't have gotten to otherwise. However, the Secret Falls are pretty much built up to be the best part of the trip, and we were forced to skip it because the access point provided by the app has a sign asking tourists to please not use it as the land is sacred to the Hawaiian people, and out of respect we turned back. I was incredibly disappointed that we were brought there in the first place and were put in that position.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"So much of the great things to see on Kauai are hidden. This app took us to wonderful spots off the beaten path and made us feel like we hadn't missed anything. As we were leaving the island, we all agreed this app made our trip.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Wonderful audio tour experience!!! This app led us to off the beaten path hidden gems which we never would have found without it.  100% recommend using this app for both Kauai tours!!!!  We loved  it !!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My fianc\u00e9 and I downloaded both the Kauai tours for our honeymoon. Both of the tours were packed with amazing destinations and fascinating facts about the rich history and culture of the island!!\n\nI particularly was a hugeeee fan of the story telling. It made the drive back pass by like nothing! Also we noticed that the tour guide didn't introduce himself in the beginning of each tour, so my fianc\u00e9 and I just nicknamed him \"bruddah!\" \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc \n\nWe're looking forward to our future trip to Maui so we can hear from Bruddah again!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This is the private tour guide that I've always wanted - funny, informative, easy to use and very reasonably priced. I agree with other reviewer - I wish there could be more great Hawaiian music in the gaps (and maybe a warning that you missed the turn?)","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Directions were spot on, crazy how the app knew where we were the whole time.   The tour guide was very friendly sounding and would have left him a good tip afterwards if we could.  Great experience and will recommend to my patients when I get back home","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was the ONLY way to make it all the way thru our day and see each and every \"must see\". It took the stress out of mapping and planning from our guidebook so the navigator in the car got her nose out of a book and was able to lookee lou around rather than missing things. It was a good thing we planned on an all day adventure though - the 2 to 4 hours easily passes and we spent nearly 10 hours.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"There is way too much to do, and far too much to see to be able to fully capture the grandeur and awe that is Kauai. That being said, the key to fully appreciating every precious minute of your vacation is to be efficient with the time you do spend in your travels.  This app ensures that you get the best views overlooking the canyons and beaches, takes you off the beaten paths to the special, hidden places reserved just for locals and those \"in the know,\" and avoids wasting the costly minutes or even hours spent looking in vain for parking, dining, gas\/fuel and restrooms.  The stories along the way are very informative, entertaining and funny (albeit somewhat corny at times).  These tours are a perfect beginning \/ starting place for those visiting for the first time, and there's plenty of info to keep you engaged and entertained even if you're a regular. Perfect for those looking for a \"locals' opinion\" on where to go and what to do; but still wanting a personalized tour that you can go and do at your own pace, and take as little or as much time as you'd like.  There's even background music to set the Hawaiian mood. Just be sure to download the entire tour over wifi before you leave the hotel.  And bring a car charger, and an audio cable to plug into the stereo. But most of all, remember to have fun!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This tour app is da kine. The gps helps time stories, route turns and highlights perfectly and we were shown some nice off the beaten path spots. Well worth the 5 bucks per tour. If we travel to any of the other Hawaiian islands we will definitely look up other tours.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We purchased both tours and found them fun, informative and helpful. We did just about everything on both tours and it happily led us to several places we would not have found on our own. The directions were spot on and the stories kept us entertained between stops. Highly recommend if you are visiting Kauai.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We live on Oahu and love to travel to the other islands. This app is informative and a great way to tour the island on your own and learn the history of the island chain.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We did the Maui & Kauai Shaka tours! They were great! We learned about the history & culture of Hawaii & knew where to stop so we didn't miss a thing. We told everyone we saw on the tour routes about the app. Several of these people used it & loved it too!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Mahalo, for this app!  We had the best time taking both Kauai tours and learned a lot at the same time.  And the views! Wow! Totally recommending this app to any one who is going to Hawaii!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The only reason I'm giving this app a 4 and not a 5 is the lack of music. My family of 8 and I agree that the silence between stops was misleading. We kept think something was wrong with the app or that we lost a signal. Other than this minor issue, we loved it!  It was like having a tour guide in the car with us, except this much cheaper!  Completely worth the cost for both tours! \nWe've been to Kauai several times but this was a nice way to learn something new about our favorite island.  We recommended the app to many others we met along our trip!\nThank you!  Brilliant idea!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Totally made our road trips great, kept kids involved and we ended up really waiting to hit milestones to hear it play . No brainer!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We used both the Kauai tours available from Shaka. It was excellent and proved to be invaluable. We had limited time and the app provided great value by covering each section exhaustively. It even showed a couple of secret spots that were awesome. In addition to turn by turn direction, the app also provided great information & interesting stories that made the drive more interesting. I would highly recommend this app for Kauai based on my experience.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Makes it easy to see the sites on your own timetable. Includes lots of different stops, gives perfect driving directions even without cell service, and includes lots of interesting historical and cultural tidbits.  Really a great price for the equivalent of a bus tour you'd pay much more for, while also adhering to someone else's schedule. So much better than trying to keep up with guidebook directions and simultaneously take in the sites. I wish there were more!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"We had an amazing day because of this app! It may seem expensive for an app but totally worth it in comparison with a tour per person. We saw breath taking views, wonderful hikes with lengths and expectations, stories and history made it entertaining for all. We had the best poke and happened upon the Friday festival in Hanapepe because of this app. We are going to try another tomorrow.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I was so worried that I would miss the best of Kauai but with this app we saw the best of the north shore's beauty as well as the legends. It was so worth it! The other guides are so costly and you feel like cattle but with this guide we took the north shore in on our terms and pace. \nGreat to feel like we got the more out of our day!\nThanks For the great drive Shaka!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Easy to use and we used it offline with GPS function in my iPhone. Tour instruction came on at just the right time before approaching the location. Other than description of the site, stories are told to augment the appreciation of the island. The best $4.99 that I had spent for self guided app for a car trip.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I had some download troubles in public wifi, and I emailed the tech support in the app. In well less than an hour, I got a phone call from Shaka customer support! I had fixed my own problem but I was so impressed to get the call! It was a wonderful tour with great hidden gems! I can't wait to do the other tour this week!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

We love Shaka and would recommend it to anyone who likes to experience a vacation on their own time without having the hassle of a tour.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We had fun and enjoyed the tour. You get the same shtick that you'd get on a guided tour bus, but you have the added benefits that you go at your own pace, stop where you want to stop, and you can turn off the corny pastiche whenever you want to. All in all certainly worth the $5.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"This is a great companion for driving around the island. Definitely provided us with some information and history that we hadn't heard previously. When we go to the other islands, we'll be getting more tours to listen to. Thanks!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was awesome. The poke at the fish market is a must! Beautiful drive up wimea canyon . Wow. Breathtaking. Guide was funny and full of great stories ! Will use on other islands if have the chance! Want to see one of other areas of Kauai - poi pu Lihue and Kapaa also :)","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This tour was great, informative and humorous. Yes, the jokes can be a little eye rolling but would you rather have fun and silliness or a dry tour? We really enjoyed the tour. Thanks Shaka! We then purchased the road to Hana tour on our Maui stop.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The app works fine.  Does what it describes.  Needs to give more warning about difficult trails and tell people that you can actually die if you swim at certain beaches.  I know that's cryptic, but that's what I read about secret beach in Kauai. The app does warn users, but they should be more firm.  Anyhow, I recommend it.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Oddly enough I first found the Shaka Kauai tour information thru a desperate google search rather than the App Store, but when I found an iPhone app was available for this guide... sold!  Yes it is probably one of the most expensive iPhone apps any user will buy, but considering that you could have easily spent $100+\/pp on a bus tour instead, this app is well worth its value. Like advertised, it worked magnificently to automatically start audio at your route points ... even in a rare spot where no cell reception could be obtained!  One note to the user - heed the author's advice in tour time length suggestions. The \"side trips\" for photo ops or hiking trails may be easily overlooked to think you could.  Breeze through both Kauai tours in the same day, but as I quickly found out when you stop worrying about the map and where you have to go next and think about the fun of the day's tour, time flies really fast!!!  All said, I'm very impressed with this tour guide app and fully plan to purchase the Maui version for the final leg of my vacation tomorrow!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was amazing. For $4.99 we had a better day then we would of had on a guided tour. You don't miss a thing with this app. It was very helpful and we'll be using it again tomorrow as we explore the other side of the island","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"We used both the Waimea Canyon and North shore driving tours and they were fun! I think the Waimea Canyon tour was better than the North Shore tour because it seemed to contain more substantive content. These tours made our tour around the island a lot more fun. Couldn't imagine driving around without them!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"It's as if your cousin went to Kauai to college and halfway through freshman year, when he knew a little but not much, he took you on a drive around the island. Directions were kinda off, facts\/stories were kinda true (and some definitely not), and tone was young and occasionally questionable. DIRECTIONS - After the third time he said \"turn NOW\" and it was the wrong place, we just ignored his directions and looked at the map. FACTS\/STORIES - Even as first-time visitors, we knew some facts were either partly or entirely wrong; lazy research or intentionally sacrificed to make a joke. STYLE - As indigenous people ourselves, we question the switch from semi-professional tone to \"I'm talking like a native, so you know you're supposed to laugh at me.\" Did not expect to be driving around Hawaii thinking about Amos & Andy.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I had never heard of this app and when I stumbled upon it wondered if it would be worth it. It totally is!! We ended up purchasing both tours for Kauai as it kept us from getting lost, helped lead us to lots of sweet spots we otherwise would not have found, and kept us entertained all the while.  The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is 1) it led us to a waterfall area that is sacred to local people and when we arrived there, a sign had actually been posted by the locals asking us to please respect their culture and not access the site.  It is still a public area so anybody can access the site but can doesn't mean should, and 2) as my husband and I entered the ditch with the hanging bridge site, we felt highly uncomfortable after a conversation with men who live there at the bridge site.  It appeared there was a homeless camp there, with people living out of old vehicles etc.  Pretty sketchy and I didn't feel entirely safe, as we were the only tourists there. Everything else was totally spot on and we wish we had this type of app for everywhere we travel :)","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Excellent!!! The tour guide takes you to off the path sites you would never find on your own, it allows you to explore at your own pace. The tour guide provides Hawaiian history and folklore and the Hawaiian music is wonderful! We will be purchasing this app again when we go to tour Oahu! Make sure you have an audio cable or Bluetooth connection to play the audio through the car speakers!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The tours available for purchase in this app are highly educational and entertaining for all ages. I had two kids in the car with us, ages 6 and 4, and they really enjoyed all the stories, music, and history. This app made the long drives a lot more interesting. I would recommend this app to anyone doing these drives, and would definitely use them again on Kauai or other islands.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Makes the trip much better. You dont even have to plan or stress. just follow what the guide says to do and you will have a lot of fun.\n\nHaha and dont worry about the person who rated it 1 star..

{"body":"I have to say that we loved these apps. We used them on Oahu, Maui, and Kauai. We rented a car on each island and didn't want to get stuck on some guided tour where they determine what you see and how long you stay. Can't beat the price either! And we really enjoyed the details and history on the stops. I highly recommend the Shaka apps!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"If your looking to drive your self around Hawaii this is the best way to get the most of your time on the road while not staring at a map or book. Used your app for Maui Road to Hana, Hawaii Volcano Park, Kauai North Shore and Waimea Canyon.  I was with my wife and 3 young sons and we loved every tour.  The tour guide is great, especially when he uses the \"talk story\" in the pigeon dialogue. The history lessons were informative, well done and kept our attention.  We were directed to all the points of interest as well as some hidden ones with all the insider info on each stop. Buy this app don't look any further.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I'm so happy I found this app! This added much more to our tour of the Waimea Canyon and surrounding areas. The narrator is informative and entertaining, and the music is a nice little touch. It was a thorough tour--we didn't feel like we missed anything. I highly recommend this app for anyone driving to this part of Kauai!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I got this app in the hope that it would make it easier to find overlooks and trailheads.  It did that and so much more!  The various stories and legends that play along the way kept my kids' attention (ages 12, 10, and 7) so well that they started reminding me to start the tour each time we got back in the vehicle.  Also fun was watching our progress on the map as we hiked the Canyon Trail - which also kept the kids motivated!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We loved using these guides!!  Directions were easy to follow and stories were informative and fun!!!  We also used the one for Volcanoes National Park on the big island and it was just as good.  We had to use a guidebook and companions app for the rest of the big island and it wasn't nearly as good.  Highly recommended!! Thank you!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I highly recommend this App to anyone wanting to tour the island in your own vehicle. We were able to do things at our own pace. And we learned some very interesting Hawaiian history. We purchased both tours for Kaua'i and the $4.99\/tour is nothing compared to what you would pay tour guide company!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I think the app is great and is really an awesome way to see the island.  It is nice to be able to go at your own pace and still have expert tour advice.\n\nI had already used a competitors app for the big island tour, and I do like the features, design and content of your app better.  The audio content was much more entertaining and the music and pop culture references were a nice touch!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We had never done a GPS driving tour and where concerned about whether it would work or not. Shaka Kauai worked perfectly. It was easy and enjoyable to use. We experienced some parts of the island that we likely would never have found on our own. The narrator is upbeat and informative, providing stories and facts that made the tour come to life. Absolutely, the best $5 we've spent on this vacation.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This has made our trips so much better. Not only have we been able to see so many sights that we had never seen before, we didn\u2019t have to spend time researching the island before coming over. Shaka gives so much information on the islands and is great at storytelling.  Highly recommend this app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I am SO glad I found & downloaded this app! We (husband, 2 kids & I) drive to the 7 sacred pools & back with this tour on the entire time. It was so incredibly helpful, fun & educational! We loved hearing the history stories on the way back. This trip to Hana & back would NOT have been the same, or half the fun, without this app!!! I can\u2019t recommend it enough!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This user friendly app had great tips and led us on some very rewarding side trips! Also the cheesy dad jokes were very much appreciated during the long drives, and we had some good laughs. I was honestly really impressed with how well the app functioned, and I wish Shaka guide could narrate all my GPS back home. Google should look into hiring whoever made this","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I don\u2019t need to write a long love fest. It\u2019s already been said by others. In a nutshell, it\u2019s a well made app. The engineers have thought of nearly everything in a travel app. My wife even asked, while we were driving, wouldn\u2019t it be awesome if you had tours like this for everywhere you go. Hmm, something to think about guys. There\u2019s a market. Well worth the money.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"We have done this trip many times but with the guided tour using the app, it was the best time ever\u203c\ufe0fThe guide was great, the stops amazing, and after you stop the app automatically picks up where it left off using your GPS. The guide also takes you places you generally don\u2019t know about. It gives information for food, restrooms and other helpful insights on your way to Hana. I highly recommend this app. Thanks for a great day in the road to Hana.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"We loved loved loved the classic road to hana tour! Everyone should use it! It was so informative and funny and we saw so many incredible things that we wouldn\u2019t have seen without this tour! We also love learning so all of the stories and history lessons about Hawaii were such a special treat!!! We will definitely tell our family and friends to use it! A+ WE LOVED IT!!!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Loved all the neat and interesting stories. Music was great and enjoyable without having any long stretches of silence. I liked how it gave us the option to see some of the smaller points of interest if we prefer but also which ones to skip if we were short on time. The only suggestion I have is to add a landscape orientation option. I had to charge my phone but because I had my phone standing from in verticals orientation, the charger got in the way. Also, while the app is already pretty amazing already, there\u2019s always room for improvement. By rewriting some of the coding to make it more efficient, it\u2019ll be less taxing on the battery drainage. Overall, great app and would definitely recommend to anyone looking to do RTH.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We used Shaka for a loop tour around Hana and it was the perfect guide for us to, through, and out of Hana. The narration and songs taught us about Hawaiian history and culture, connecting what we saw along the road with a rich cultural past. It suggested hikes and lookouts and told us which ones were best. In the beginning, we were nervous about getting lost or missing a piece of the tour, but with Shaka, the maps, tour, and navigation were pre-downloaded to our phone, which helped us feel we knew where we were at and where to go. I would HIGHLY recommend this app to anyone doing ANY Road to Hana tour. We will definitely be using this when we return to Hana and elsewhere in Hawaii!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"So glad we downloaded the Shaka app before going on the road to Hana!! It was so easy to use and it alerted us of all the best attractions to stop, parking and specific directions for each. I definitely recommend this app! It also plays authentic Hawaiian music and tells historical stories of the towns and its people in between attractions. It\u2019s a good one!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This app could not be more perfectly suited for either the serious tourist wanting the \u201creal\u201d Hawaiian experience or the causal day trip to just hang out and relax.  Loaded with tons of secrets, cultural history, and food tips.  A must have if you want to see the east side of Maui.  Expert guides you to all the best ways to experience the road to Hana through the tropical rainforest with its waterholes, waterfalls and lava tubes.  Get this app it is worth every penny!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We loved using this tour on our drive to Hana and beyond! So entertaining and helpful. We loved the music in between stops, the stories, history and directions that provided great perspective on where and what was was worth a stop!! Such an amazing tour that enhanced our trip greatly. Would definitely recommend and would purchase other tours from this app for other areas. Thank you for the great tour and resource!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

Listening through the rental car it feels like the guide is sitting next to you, and the GPS is so accurate that when the guide says \u201cpull over and park here\u201d it makes perfect sense. It was informative, fun, and extremely well done with a lot of care and pride in the work. Thank you for giving us such a memorable day! You will surely miss out on the Road to Hana if you do it any other way. Mahalo!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"The app enriched our experience in Maui and helped us make the most of it. Short of hiring a private tour guide for a whole day, there really is no way to beat the app. The only improvement I would like to see- maybe have it play some relaxing Hawaiian music while the guide isn\u2019t speaking.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"First time we have tried a tour app, and weren\u2019t disappointed!  Great to know about all things along the way and to know Exactly where things are!  Will definitely do more shacks tours! Mahalo! The Rogers from Ohio.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app did not work for me. I purchased the $20 bundle for all of the routes because I wasn\u2019t sure at the time of the purchase which routes I was going to drive while in Maui. I downloaded the routes prior to my flight and discovered they didn\u2019t save to my phone when I opened the app back up the next day. The same thing continued to happen. I would download the apps and they disappeared shortly after. I was in the process of downloading them again when I started driving from the southern part of Maui up to Hana Highway, but it never finished and I lost cell phone reception. I later searched through the app and saw this message on their help page: \n\n\u201cUnfortunately there is a random bug in our app that causes some users to lose their download after closing the app. We are working hard to get this fixed. Right now the best solution is to leave the app open until the download is completely finished and then tap \u2018ready to go\u2019  and then \u2018start the tour\u2019. This seems to lock in the tour. If this has happened to you we are very sorry! We hope to get this fixed ASAP.\u201d \n\nThe download takes a long time. I could not have judged how much time I would have needed to pull over to the side of the road and wait for the downloads to complete, and I did not know if they would work even after all that. It was a frustrating experience to say the least. Luckily, my hotel had given me a hard copy of sites and mile markers worth stopping at on the way to Hana. I ended up using their directions instead.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I should admit I am blow away by this tour. I am using I phone for 9 yrs and never ever bought any thing from App Store . We went to Hawaii and tried to do road to Hanna by our self and only made it half way on first day . That\u2019s to seeing not much . Then we went to tickets for less and Ron there suggested to download this app . I did and figured out it was paid. Took the heli tour in am and then at heliport bought this tour and downloaded on lte . Took 5 minutes or so and then started to Hanna . There is so much to do that you can do all in one day so for first timer do it in 2 days !! We skipped all the first days spot and any hikes and made all the way to 80 feet fall . Did not go to the 7 sacred pool as it was already 4:30 pm . The app for fun . Tell you interesting facts and also I think 10 $ we\u2019ll spent . I would advise to buy the hole Maui package for any trip you take as it will help you to see and this helped us the second day . We should have app for every tourist spots like this . I am thinking about making my own and make a company out of it lol .","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We downloaded this app and 2 tours. The first one was the Full Loop Road to Hana tour. We were pleasantly surprised at how well the app worked. Even without cell coverage the app uses GPS part of your phone and gets the turns, pullovers, suggestions spot on!  \nWe were happy with the first tour, so we ended up doing the west Maui Tour as well. \nIf you are going to do the full loops of the island, get a Jeep Wrangler as your rental car, for those unpaved parts of the roads. \nThe narrator is a little corny, but entertaining with his Hawaiian stories and Aloha spirit. \nTwo thumbs up!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My friend and I were excited to use this app after all the positive reviews. I paid the downloaded the app, paid the $20, and we hit the road...only to find out that you had to download individual files too, in addition to the app and buying the tours. So we tried to do this along the trip, but reception is tough for much of the road to Hana, and even though we just wanted to download the road to Hana file, the app made us download everything, and in a particular order. We ended up stopping at a coffee stop along the way and successfully downloaded it via their wi-fi. Once again, excited to be on our way, we plugged our phone in and set up the audio system. And it worked for maybe one segment, but anytime you disconnect your phone to take photos, you had to reconnect and figure out where you were again. And for some reason the app wouldn\u2019t work properly with our car system, so I spent half of the trip fiddling with the audio system to figure out why the app would stop in the middle of a segment and go to a screen with music files. I\u2019d restart the segment and it would happen all over again. I ended up watching my car\u2019s audio system for half the trip, instead of enjoying the road to Hana.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"In spite of the app saying no data is needed, if you haven\u2019t downloaded the maps and narratives before starting you\u2019ll be screwed just like I was. I wound up going to Hana without the tour and when I downloaded the rest in a restaurant in Hana, it finally worked. Trouble is, it doesn\u2019t work the same in reverse, so basically I missed everything except for the history of the kings and queens that I listened to on my way home. Interesting but not worth the $9.99 cost. Bummer!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"We debated whether to get the App or not. It was completely worth the money. The locations are hard to find and not everything is marker. I had mapped out what we wanted to see and wouldn\u2019t have been able to find half of what we did without it. \nWe really enjoyed listening to the stories and history as well. \nGreat job!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"If you like a road trip, don\u2019t try doing one in Hawaii without Shaka Guide. We used 3 apps on Big Island, Maui and Oahu. Easy to follow directions, fun and informative. We saw many hidden treasure we would\u2019ve been sure to have missed if we\u2019d have gone at it alone. The food recommendations ensured we had \u2018ono grinds and by our 8th tour we were even singing along to some of the tunes and testing one another on the local legends!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"To say this guide was helpful is an understatement. It was 100% NECESSARY for our first time doing the Road to Hana. I honestly don\u2019t know how we would have found everything we wanted to see without the helpful, sometimes hilarious, always informative narrator. The directions and landmarks to guide us were very helpful and, like I said, I\u2019m not sure we would have found things so easily if it weren\u2019t for this guide. A quick note: this guide works with GPS and we were able to use the entire guide (which I had already downloaded with WiFi as suggested) with little to no cell service the entire time. I highly suggest getting this app if you are like me and need to be walked through exactly how to get somewhere to ease your anxiety and\/or if you don\u2019t want to miss out of some amazing stops.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was beyond helpful!!  It not only was spot on with all the things coming up along the road...   but it was super informative about the history of the island.  Also, the guy doing the voice was hysterical and made the heart pounding drive easier to deal with!  We also gave the tour guide a cheesy name and even wondered if we should have downloaded more of the Shaka apps...  that\u2019s how enjoyable this made the Road to Hana!!!  We have already recommended this app to friends looking to travel to Maui - great job!!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

We could see everything with ease and the knowledge of someone else guiding us each step of the way. We would never have found the hidden gems or where to park. All the little things that are so important like rest stops, water,gas and food made the trip comfortable. We loved the informative narration, music and chuckled at the jokes.

{"body":"Only works one way around Hana Loop. If you realize your mistake too late due to the buying options not being very clear you will be well into your trip with no cell signal to download correct map. It should work either way around the loop with a dip switch setting to tell the app which way you decide to take the loop. Very simple fix but they obviously only want to steer you towards their $19.99 package option.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Overall the app is really great for tourists. It\u2019s a great guide for knowledge and music and especially helps with knowing where to park and what to expect around corners. It doesn\u2019t cover quite everything on the road to Hana, but it\u2019s still jam packed with the highlights. \n\nMy biggest gripes (and the reasons for the 4 stars) are there were several stops\/details that were outdated and then every time when the audio comes in, it\u2019s very loud and startling. It\u2019s a little jarring when you\u2019re trying to pay attention to the windy road. Mostly it\u2019s the out of date things that bugs me the most. A few updates and it would be a great app.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Took the west loop tour and was blown away by the scenery and landscape. The Shaka tour app was amazing and helped navigate through some tight sections of the island.

We were not sure whether or not we wanted to pay extra for the app as we had multiple maps and had talked to a lot of locals as to where to stop. Once I decided to pay for it (mainly so GPS could work with no service), we then weren\u2019t going to listen to the guidance the whole time. I am glad we, first opted to pay for the app, and second we opted to listen to the ENTIRE guided tour. It was worth every penny. We loved our tour guide and learned so much.

Get started by 8am if you want to take full advantage of your day and for sure hike to the 400ft falls above the \u201c7 Sacred Pools\u201d at the far end of the tour.

We also used the Haleakala and West Maui coastline app which lead us to places we may have missed if not for the app prompts!  App is super easy to use!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We really found the directions and local history helpful and enjoyable on the west Maui coastline tour. We never would have found some of the points of interest in the tour on our own. It really helps to know where to park and walk as well. The one thing that could be improved is that there should be a caution added for the part of the tour that is on on a one lane, winding and very narrow road. You actually have to back up if you meet another car. He briefly mentions to look out for cars in the road ahead but does not mention this will go on for mile after mile. There should be a suggestion that those who are not up for this may want to turn around.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We travel a lot and this tour is so detailed and prompts everything right on time! It made our experience driving effortless and keeps you occupied! Awesome app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We really enjoyed the Shaka tour around the entire east side of Maui. This app was informative, saved us time by suggesting when to stop and when not to stop at certain areas, and we enjoyed the freedom to do our our thing away from the excursions others were doing from our cruise ship. Not to mention the money it saved us! We found ourselves exploring places we never would have known existed! Thanks for creating such a great app and for spending the time to cover all the important things. Definitely recommend purchasing this app, renting a Jeep Wrangler, taking the top off and driving the entire way around. Such a fun experience!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We named our guide Kai. He\u2019s the kind of man that trusts you to make your own decisions, but just wants to make sure you get through the Road to Hana safely. He lets you know the best points of interest, but lets you know if something is all hype and a waste of time. He only\nwant the best for you. Kai is the kind of guide who\u2019s going to treat you right.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We are so glad that we purchased this app. The guide led us to all of the great spots along the road to Hana and gave us a great lesson on Hawaiian history. We were pleased that we were able to do everything at own pace. You won\u2019t regret purchasing this app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We did the loop to Hana. We were very impressed with the exactness and details he gave us. Our favorite stops were Red sand beach and Venus pools. Wear your swimsuit and jump off the rocks! It was so fun! Thanks Shaka Guide!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We did this on a VERY rainy day.  Just a fabulous thing to do, the Shaka guide made it so much fun.  LOVED the historical parts, lots of good stories about the islands.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I never leave reviews but I had to after using this app for the Road to Hana tour- it was great! It took me almost 11 hours to do on my own but the time honestly flew by because the guide was awesome and hilarious. I\u2019m so glad I did this instead of a crowded tour bus because I was able to pick and choose what I wanted to see, and how long I wanted to stay at each stop. Highly recommend! Thanks for the highlight of my first trip to Maui. Mahalo and a hui hou!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I seldom write app reviews but I couldn\u2019t wait to write up a review on this app!  I\u2019m so glad that a goggle search led me to find the Shaka Maui guide to do the Hana road while taking a vacation cruise to Maui!  The cruise line was going to charge $195 (per person ) to do the Hana road, but with a $70 Jeep rental, full tank of gas and packed lunch ( at a store we stopped at that was recommended by guide on app), we were on our way. The guide was amazing, providing great details, music and stories along the way, and recommendations on which stops to make, and ones to skip in order to save time and get to the places you really want to see. This was so easy to use. If you want to have a great time, save money and find the best things to explore on the Hana road, you won\u2019t go wrong getting this app!  It\u2019s worth the price!  (Uhh, did you see the fee the cruise line was charging??!?). PS. There are lots of curves on the road, but easily manageable!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Fantastic stories and guide. The directions were very precise and helpful. It made for a wonderful adventure on Maui. I\u2019d try any of their apps.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Just got back from Maui! We used three of the tours; west side loop, Haleakal\u0101 sunrise, and classic road to Hana. We loved it! Great stories\/history and music  along the way. Great suggestions for vistas and hikes to take...and even suggests with ones to skip if you're pressed for time. I have been to Maui ten times and have taken all these roads before, this app made it so fun.. like doing it for the first time. Totally worth the money, don\u2019t even hesitate! Ps. I\u2019m the type that hates spending money on apps.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great way to drive the road to Hana.\nDescriptive with plenty of opportunities to view the sights. Much better than reading a travel guide and nice to go at your own pace and not that of tour company.\nHighly recommend!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Hands down this was the smartest (and cheapest) thing we did in Maui. We had planned to just take off and drive the road to Hana, but by looking for just an online map we found this app. Skeptical at first but decided to pay for the guided tour. No chance we would have come even close to seeing everything we did without it. Yes there was a lot of stopping, walking and hiking but once we got to the final destination (most not visible from the road) it was breathtaking and totally worth it. Not to mention there is zero cell service on the entire road. Having the OFFLINE guide was awesome. We have only used this app for the road to Hana so I can\u2019t speak for any other guides tours, but if their anything like this one you would be wasting time and money by not having it. This is the only app I have ever given 5 stars to. It\u2019s a must.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I\u2019ve never reviewed an IOS app before, but these apps (both the Maui and Oahu apps) are absolutely five stars. For a minimal charge each tour will probably give you ten hours of value. My wife and I just came back from our first trip to Hawaii and cannot say enough great things about these apps. The tour guide is so personable and the material so engaging that it really made our trip even better than we thought possible. Now that we\u2019re back in the snow we sometimes play a clip from the app to remind us of our trip. My only suggestion would be to add CarPlay support to make controlling the app when driving a bit easier. \n\nOverall this app is a home run!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was a great road trip addition, informative, engaging and full\nof great tips for this all day adventure.  Truly some of the best money spent on my trip Maui!  The ride back with the history of Hawaii was a bonus!  Looking forward to its use next time!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We really enjoyed the stories, the music and all the information given on the Shaka tour. We saw everything we wanted to see with clear and easy to follow directions. It made the trip a breeze and way less stressful driving. Thank you Shaka. I wish I would have known about this earlier when we did the Haleakala sunrise, totally would have used the Shaka guide!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We are from Utah (the best SNOW on Earth). We came to Maui for our 34th wedding Anniversary \ud83d\udc95. Your Shaka guide wears so enjoyable, entertaining, and informative. Best app ever, we love the History and legends on the islands\ud83c\udf34 \ud83c\udf34 \ud83c\udf34. We will definitely and have already recommended the apps","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We just finished the full loop and quite literally would have been lost without this wonderful app.  Trying to use the \u201cCD\u201d method of navigating would be hopeless.  The GPS allows for letting you know exactly what to see and where to stop. Highly recommend!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We have been coming to Maui since 2011 and this time driving the road to Hana was amazing. This app tells you when to turn, where to park, and so much more that driving today mad it amazing. We have seen things that we never even knew existed before we got this app!!! So recommend download it and is worth every penny!!  Make sure you download everything before you go though and bring a car charger. We forgot so we missed out on the backside. \ud83d\ude12","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Awesome! Worked great, informative and had interesting stories of the history of the island. Delivered much more than I expected.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is a MUST for anyone who is on their first (or second or third) trip to Hana!  It was eerily accurate in locations, and it didn\u2019t skip a beat when we were well outside of cell phone range!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Best app to get for road to Hana! Made the trip amazing. Favorite part is the music that played between the stops!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I rented a JEEP and traveled the Road to Hana by myself today. Shaka gave great tips and helped me manage my time. I wanted to take extra time for hiking and exploration, so it was nice that he gave options for both the touristy stops as well as the ones a little off the beaten path. The history lesson on the way home was great too! This is a must have app! Drive slow!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We did the sunset tour tonight!  Awesome!  That road is a little scary... more so as we were coming up as the sun hit your eyes at points the visor wasn\u2019t very big on the Jeep.  The trip was so worth it!  Love the commentary and songs to keep you included in the history of the area in your journey.  We are taking road to Hana tomorrow we loved it sooo much!  Hope you make more of these for other areas.  Little dude stops are great too!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Used this app on our first trip to Hana and it was great!! Very accurate descriptions of where to park for sites and awesome narration! The tour guide is great and he even tells you which sites you can skip for times sake if needed! I would highly recommend this app to anyone doing the trip! It has built in GPS and will play narrations as you get close to each site. We did lose service for a lot of the tour, but I would watch the GPS and just play the narration if our GPS wasn\u2019t working properly so we didn\u2019t miss a thing! Overall, this app is great!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is a must have for the road the Hana. Make sure you download the map prior to leaving for your trip, WiFi needed. At the start of our trip, the app didn\u2019t start right away. We learned that we had to open the app first. Shaka does a good job of announcing stops prior to arrival. Each destination was right on. Area of improvement; I recommend more stories in the beginning of the tour.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"We have all been to Maui before but this trip was the best by far bc we used shaka guide to learn about the island! Definitely will use it for other island trips\ud83d\ude0a!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We used this app on our loop trip to Hana it is interactive and worked perfectly. Each stop is explained so you can decide to stop or not. It even helps you find a place to park. Worth every penny.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We stumbled upon a recommendation of this guide while watching a You Tube video about the backside drive from Hana. We had another guide we used to Hana, which was great, but this guide was amazing- using GPS, hawaiian music, history...it had it all. Get this if you going to Hana. Oh! And they have other guides for the other islands!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Such a cool app to see the amazing views of Maui and get all the stories and suggestions along the way!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We used this tour during a 12 hour stop in Maui while on a cruise ship.  The tour narration is outstanding.  Gives you advice based upon the time of day whether you should do all the stops or just a few.  We drove past Hana to the National Park which is the end of the tour and then took same route back.  The tour is filled with lots of information.  If you want a good Hawaiian history lesson, the drive back from Hana is filled with lots of great information.  Our round trip time was about 7 hours and included a few stops along the way.\n\nI highly recommend this tour for anyone who is going to be on the island.  Definitely worth the money.  Remember to download the map before you start the tour as much of the trip has no cell service.  Also, connect your phone to cars speakers for best results.  We had a Jeep and drove with the top off.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great app although be sure you download it with a WiFi connection. We learned so much about Hawaii, Maui & Hana. Wonderful recommend stops on the road to Hana, excellent music & great commentary overall. Don\u2019t take the trip without it!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"What a great tour!  Thanks for making it. We had a week in Maui and were going to take the road to Hana and we found your app. My whole family enjoyed it. It was thorough even with tips on where to park, last gas or restrooms and what to see, how to find it and the history as we were driving!  Even timeline of what you will have time to do depending on when you left for the tour. \n\nThe only thing I can think would be if you could quickly interject a reminder on the way back saying, here is that waterfall on the right if you skipped it.  I know you did it for most but probably had to interrupt the history which was great too by the way. \n\nReally great app!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This guide is a must have for your trip to Maui.  It is informative, fun, and entertaining.  Our Road to Hana trip was made much more delightful and easy because of the app.  I enjoyed the narrative and the history.  Highly recommend!!  The guide for Haleakala is also a must have.  No better way to take the journey than with Shaka Guide!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My wife and I heard about this app from a friend and it was worth the $8.00!! We got an early start so we didn\u2019t have to deal with crowds and I loved the history! We also heard other cars drive by playing the app which was also cool!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This tour is worth its weight in gold! Such a fun way to independently see the Road to Hana. Can\u2019t recommend it enough!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We did the traditional Road to Hana Tour and it was awesome. We were able to see all of the best and maybe even lesser known locations. We were also provided with incredible history of the island that had my six children enthralled for hours. We would highly recommend Shaka to anyone!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"It was so fun and entertaining to listen to all day! Well worth the $16.99 for all the tours. We did the Haleakala sunrise tour and then did the reverse road to Hana. It was very educational and took us to the places that aren\u2019t crowded and some people don\u2019t know about!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We had 3 nights planned for Hana and used this guide to get us to Hana in day one. \n\nThe guide is well produced, slightly amusing, and completely worth the cost.\n\nThe only way there\u2019s anything negative to say about it is you don\u2019t read their recommendations to download the maps and such *before * you go via WiFi.\n\nMany parts of the road have no cell service, but gps will continue to work fine.\n\nThe guide drew our attention to a few things we never would have stopped for and were very glad we did and a few we wouldn\u2019t have stopped for but weren\u2019t bothered that we did.\n\nMy recommendation is to not try to cram too much into too little time and follow the overall suggestions. They are mostly spot on.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

Definitely pointed out some things we would have missed. Great job!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My family and I used this app for the road to Hana and the sunrise trip. I was constantly without service, but this app kept going which was perfect. A family actually stopped us to ask us for directions because they lost service and their gps cut out, but ours was still going. Even once we were heading back down we left the guide on and were told very interesting stories that were a lot of fun to listen to on the ride. It also brought us to cool towns to stop in. Would highly recommend to anyone, even if you know the way it points out so much you may not know!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We stopped at Hana Headquarters for a packed picnic lunch and they suggested we download this app before we left town. We were so glad we did! This app guides you through the wonders on the road in fun, informative way that also keeps you on schedule. We wouldn\u2019t have found several cool stops without it! Mahalo for creating this wonderful guide!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"It is an excellent app, very very helpful.  The app not only recommended us the points of interest on the road, the legendary stories but also remind us timing of the trip.  Have to give 5 starts for this app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The app does not appear to store information, so it needs to download the tour each time you use it.  If you only purchased one tour, that likely isn\u2019t a problem, but if you purchased the $16 package of tours, you can never get them all downloaded. You can\u2019t choose the order it downloads, and the app seems to flush the memory each time it is not running on screen. I never was able to use any of the tours I purchased.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"We used the West Maui and road to Hana guides and both were super helpful in guiding our trip! It made the trip stress free without having to worry about reading maps or guides.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The valet at our hotel asked what we were doing that day as he pulled up our car.  When we mentioned we were driving the road to Hana, he recommended this app.  It MADE our trip perfect.  It felt like we had the most experienced tour guide in the world with us.  In addition to being very detailed and explaining each site we were coming up to, it also made recommendations on when to stop and when to keep driving (\u201cthis waterfall is ok, but you will see much better in 30 minutes...recommend not stopping\u201c), it was also smart and funny!  If you drove past a scenic spot the app knew this because the timing of the GPS indicated we kept moving, so it would say \u201cok, so I guess you didn\u2019t want to see that\u201d.  Kept us engaged for 6 or 8 hours as we drove along.  At one point we stopped at an overlook after we just heard the story of a church built with coral and there was a tourist with their tour guide standing next to us, and he was stumbling for a good explanation about the church, so I just started to repeat all that I just heard on the app and the tourist asked how I knew all that, and I explained about the great app while the tour guide (who knew next to nothing and was really just an overpaid Uber driver) scowled at me!  Anyway, GREAT app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We named the tour guide Steve. He was absolutely wonderful and made the road to Hana so entertaining. I\u2019m pretty sure without Steve\u2019s constant jokes we would have been extremely bored and lacked laughter during our day in the car. I would recommend everyone download this app before venturing into the windy roads to Hana.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Be patient!! At the start of your tour your so excited and ready to see some amazing sites and you think you have missed some spots...don\u2019t get frustrated trust your guide the most amazing spots are in the middle and at the end!

{"body":"Tremendous app and extremely helpful for staying on track and prioritizing.  Can\u2019t imagine doing something like the drive to Hana and other places without it.  Enjoyed the background, history and insight.  Only disappointment was the quality of the Hana picnic sandwiches and that may be the opportunity for the Shaka Guide.  Maui Revealed has objective reviews of eating options.  I don\u2019t know that the Shaka Guide objectively reviews any.  I think that can be done like Maui Revealed does it where it effectively encourages the vendors to improve and steers users to better options until thy do.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was a great guide for us on the road to Hana! Worked very well and gave us both insider tips and stories to go along with this long journey.

Thank you!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I was skeptical as to how well the application would work, but I have to say it was the best buy of our vacation!  The road to Hana has little to no cell service so even my navigation applications would not work. We would have never been able to do a self guided driving trip without this app!  Many spots are hard to find. Make sure you start early if you intend to take advantage of all the stops. Well worth the purchase.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My wife and I just completed The Road to Hana using the app. It was like having your own guide in the back seat .

{"body":"This app helped brought us sooooo much fun in Maui. I first bought looped road to Hana and loved it so much. Here is why:\n1. It tells you all places worth going and places can be skipped. Time flies and is so precious.\n2. It tells you many stories about Hawaii history, culture, life. \n3. It tells you the places for food, snack, ice cream, coffee, etc. at the right time and right place. I\u2019ve already missed the food there which is so unique.\n4. The music is a wonderful entertainment. We come back and found some of the music to review the memory.\n5. It reminds you about time for a few times. Also the roads that\u2019re winding or slippery. \n6. The English is clear, easy to understand and describing. So even better than a real tour guide.\n\nThen of course I bought the Haleakal\u0101 sun rise tour to be the perfect companion for us.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard but please try to expand to include other road trip places around the world. We need it!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Is the best way to describe our use of the Shaka Maui app during our stay on Maui. It was so enjoyable\u2014 the narrator of the tours was funny, down to earth and so pleasant. This whole app experience really made our trip alive & brilliant.  We loved the authentic music, historical stories which were recounted & the pacing.  We need to find a way to get a list of the music on this app!!! \n\nThe app tour was especially comforting during locations where we had no cell service - like on Hana.  The app uses navigation technology linked to tours.  This app is ingenious!!! You can read all the guide books you want to prepare for a Maui vacation, but there\u2019s nothing like a live\u2014in the moment \u2014at every twist & turn in the road tour. \n\nDon\u2019t visit Maui without this app!!! Inseparable!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Found out about this app the day before we did the road to Hana. I could not imagine the road without this app or something similar. \n\nYou can download the tour before going on your trip to save battery life\/data. You will have to use location services so that the guide can play at the correct time. The guide for the road to Hana provides all the information you need to complete this trip. Tells you all the stops and which ones are a must see. \n\n11\/10 recommend this for the road to Hana.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

Very Happy","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We did the loop tour, which was excellent (although quite bad, incredibly narrow roads on the backside, but still worth it). We also bought the Gypsy app, but after experimenting with both, ended up going with this one.

Also experienced some tech difficulties trying to jump back into the Gypsy app midway through.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This app was key to our enjoyment of the Hana experience.  We were getting a late start and using a combination of this app and some website recommendations as to where to stop and what to skip.  Every time we took a website\u2019s recommendation over Shaka\u2019s, we regretted it.  The directions were detailed and we felt as though we were being personally guided by a local.  The information provided was detailed enough for us to decide how we wanted to proceed.  Our favorite stopping points were two that we would have otherwise missed.  Definitely worth the price.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Worth twice what the app cost! Made the trip even more enjoyable if that\u2019s possible. Don\u2019t leave without it!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This app was absolutely amazing and worth the 8$. We decided to do the \u201creverse road to Hana.\u201d The tour guide that was speaking was great! It felt like he was in the car with us. We laughed at his jokes and even answered when he asked questions. It automatically plays as you follow the road in numeric order. You have the option to skip a stop and it keeps going. It also plays beautiful Hawaiian music during the off time. What\u2019s even better? They\u2019re honest! There were about 5 stops that sounded cool but the guide straight up said \u201cdon\u2019t waste your time\u201d. As you ride along, he even gives you history about the places you\u2019re going. Not boring monotoned history, fun history that even this non history person payed attention to. He tells you when a restroom was available and when the next one would be. He told you about dangers and warnings. All around this app single handedly made our road to Hana magical.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"The guide is outdated, some info was not accurate which threw us off multiple times. Also, the GPS coverage can be spotty, and the app misses some of the explanations because of that.

{"body":"Truly excellent.  GPS driven commentary and directions, hundreds of tips on where to find unlabeled trails to falls, helpful advice on the order of \u201cit's a decent stop if you have time, but there are better ones coming,\u201d nice history lessons during less scenic stretches, but best thing are the frequent status and time checks: \u201cif you're here and it\u2019s after 3, you shouldn\u2019t try the whole loop\u201d etc.  A little corny when it drops into local voice, but hey, we're tourists, we signed up for a little local corn!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"There is no service at all along the road to Hana. The app downloads everything and only relies on your GPS. It also teaches a lot about the history of Hawaii. We enjoyed it a lot.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"A lot of thought and care went into this product. The guide\u2019s tips are very specific and they are timed very well to play right when you need them. Also, locals who work at businesses along the tour route had good things to say about the creators and how they took a community-minded approach when creating the tours.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

If your in Maui and plan to drive yourself around this app includes interesting trivia and helpful navigation. If you can decide between buying one tour or the package- get the package!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"We were so grateful for the personalized tour experience. We used the app for the entire tour and enjoyed the stories and music along the way. There were multiple points when we expressed our gratefulness for the information provided. We would have otherwise driven past some really cool things or would have spent time on things that we didn\u2019t need to. Worth the $!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This app is incredible. The tour is so thorough and the guide is so fun to listen to. I loved hearing about the history, listening to the music and also the honest feedback on whether or not to stop. We made a few stops that in hindsight we would have skipped but overall, we feel like we had the best road to Hana possible considering it was our first time. Besides renting a car, downloading this app was the best money we spent on our trip. It felt like we had a third party right there with us and the guide gave us a feeling of safety and security during the hard parts of the drive when the roads were really narrow. Thank you for an amazing experience!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My kids said this was one of their favorite parts of our trip!!! We stopped at to many places along the guide That we didn\u2019t make it all the way around and Maui that day. Didn\u2019t help that we started later than we should have. I get this app 5 \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f and five \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fmore stars for the tour guide.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We usually show up at a new place and try to figure it out \u2014 which usually leads to squabbles and not really knowing the routes. Consequently, we miss a lot a good stuff. Shaka guide  was like  having someone In your car telling you where all the sights are , where the hiking trails start and where to turn and for all the things that are worth seeing. You also get the highlights of the towns that are along the way to the sights. \nWe had our best night of drinks and dinner just because Shaka had recommended  and lead us through a small town in Maui on the way home from our day of hiking and sightseeing. \n\nIn addition, we learned a lot of Hawaii history and culture along the drive. \nThis was worth a lot more than the cost of the app. You would have paid hundreds of dollars for an in person guide to tell you the same things. \nI\u2019ve used it twice in Maui and hope they are planning the app in many more locations !","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This fully downloaded and did not work multiple times. We wasted 2 hours on our short holiday trying to download and re download, unpack data and then the app failed. Don\u2019t waste your money there is another app that actually works. Maybe the developer can fix the app first and refund the families who wasted their vacation.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Though we didn\u2019t take the entire \u201croad\u201d, we did make it to Hana! AND the information, site stops, recommendations, music and history were well worth the cost of the app! It is highly recommended!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"Besides having some issues with the audio connection with our Jeep Rental, we highly recommend this tour guide! Our guide gave us great pointers, recommendations and we easily got to our destination with ease. TIMING is everything and even though we didn\u2019t do extended research with Road to Hana, this guide was so useful and put us at ease to enjoy the ride instead of trying to follow a map. Worth the $$$","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Can\u2019t imagine having done this excursion without the guidance from Gray (the app).  The narrator gives instruction on where to pull off, best viewing areas and where to stop\/not stop along the road. Every stop\/adventure was well thought out and also explains common courtesy moves.  There is virtually no service during this trip, but this app is downloaded and uses GPS to guide you. I cannot stress how much this guided tour enhanced our journey on the Road to Hana.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This is an amazing app! It tells you when to pull over to sight see, park, and get food using GPS. It also tells you when good times to turn back so you don\u2019t drive back too late. The stops were super cool and some of them are really easy to pass by if you don\u2019t know where to look (the app makes it very clear where everything is). In addition to all this, on the way back, the app tells you the history of Hawaii which was really fascinating! 100\/10 would recommend!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Loved this tour for the loop around Hana! The only improvement we can think of is to have the local music always play between each stop!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I am so glad that we stumbled onto this app while looking for directions to drive the back road to Hana. The Shaka guide was extremely informative and provided great entertainment for the day. It was very helpful that he gave you an idea of what was coming up in plenty of time and let you know where to park and when. He was honest about the spots you have to see and the ones you could probably do without. The GPS feature made it as if you really had your own personal tour guide that let you explore when and what you wanted to. We enjoyed his stories and his humor. Our only regret is that we didn\u2019t start our day earlier and we missed out on a few things after it got dark. I\u2019d recommend leaving by 6am to get a full day in. You\u2019ll never see it all but the Shaka guide really helps you have a great experience!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

I\u2019ve done the road to Hana a few times and this app has let me discover more in one trip that and all my other trips combined. The price alone is a fraction of what you would pay for a book or an audio cd in this app out shines every other resources you could imagine. There\u2019s not one thing that I could think of that is a negative or an improvement  that they need to do. \ntruly hit it out of the park great job guys!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"The perfect guide for those who want to go at their own pace! We didn\u2019t want to take a guided tour in a van\/bus and we are so happy we didn\u2019t. You don\u2019t control your stops and are limited to where the big vehicle can go. This allowed us to take our own car and stop and stay wherever we like for as long as we liked! We would have missed many of the stops if it weren\u2019t for the guide and were comfortable enough to do the full loop backside of Hana with this guidance. Just as beautiful as the more popular front side of road to Hana and some added adventure!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was extremely helpful. We went back and fourth whether to do the reverse road to Hana and are really pleased that we did. The only reason I gave this app a four was because at times you would miss attraction points because the guide didn\u2019t let you know when it was coming up and while he was telling stories about something else, you\u2019d miss it. However, this app was very informative and we were impressed with the little details along the the way!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"The app was good . It should have said we are starting at mile  marker 0. We were lookin for stuff earlier than that and we\u2019re getting frustrated that the app was not telling us where to go. There is also a lot of dead air on the app. We could not have the stereo on due to plugged in to the auxiliary to listening to the app through the car speakers. You guys should put on more Hawaiian or other music on during all that dead space.

The guided map helped us stay on route without a worry. The stories told by the guide were fascinating and taught us so much about the history of Maui. The only thing that would make this app stellar would be to have music playing throughout so that there is no dead air between audio clips. We will definitely download other tours from Shaka Guide.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"My wife and I just completed the tour on the road to Hana. The narrator on the app has a very easy going and guiding voice as opposed to one that insists you see certain things. That makes the tour easily adaptable for you and your family. Additionally, the guide gives great small bits of history along the way there and longer stories about the history of Hawaii on the road back. This, along with good local music interspersed throughout the drive, made for a very pleasant drive back to town. Another great feature is that the narrator helps you keep track of time, suggesting places to stop if you have time and places to bypass if you are running short on time.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This was an accidental find that ended up becoming a highlight of our Maui trip. The GPS-linked audio was perfectly synced and we were accurately guided to every sight\/site we wanted to see. There is generous information offered, from the history of the island to food recommendations (& reminders on timing and the gasoline station location). We were delighted to discover there are more tours for the islands we\u2019re visiting on our island hopping excursion - we will definitely be checking out the other audio tours.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I was hesitant to pay this for an app but it was WELL worth the investment!  If you are self driving The Road to Hana this is a must!  Extremely informative and well narrated. A ton of information and history!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was an absolutely stellar help on our Road to Hana cruise!! We were able to take our time and spend it where we wanted to. The affordability in comparison to a guided tour was astounding. Made it easy, even for a haole, like me. Can\u2019t wait to go back and use it again! \n\nCHEE WOOO!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This Tour guide App was amazingly well done. Very informative, very well put together. Made you feel like you missed nothing on The Road to Hana! The Best purchase we made on our vacation.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I never write reviews, we did the complete loop on the road to hana and this app was perfect. Gps enabled works flawlessly, it feels like a personal tour guide and makes a 8-12 hour day trip feel like a guided safari. Literally a must!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My husband and I used this app for our road to Hana trip during our honeymoon. We throughly enjoyed this app, very informative and helpful! It has stop by stop voice guides that make sure you get the most out of your trip to Hana! It also runs offline which is sooo helpful because I barely had service on that side of the island. If you don\u2019t wanna get over charged for a tour through a company and also get to choose which stops you want to see, go with Shaka guide! You won\u2019t be disappointed!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I downloaded this app in advance of our venture to Hana. I was disappointed in the fact that it only worked part of the time. Even the offline maps were not very helpful. I could not get the app to work while plugged in to charge my phone so my phone died on the way back.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This is a fantastic, must have app! It was like traveling with our personal guide. Had we traveled the road without it we would have missed a lot of places and wouldn\u2019t have been able to track our time. Best money spent!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We absolutely loved having the Shaka Road to Hana guide. It tracked our progress via gps in the car and was on point the entire ride. Great Hawaiian music and facts about the area and Hawaii. I highly recommend this to everyone. A must-have on the Road to Hana!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We loved this app and would not have seen half the things we did without this app!  It\u2019s a must!  We loved the history lessons too.  They were interesting and made you feel closer to the land and people.  Thanks for an amazing experience!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Using this tour made the difference in our Road to Hana day trip.  We would not have had all of the awesome experiences we had without it!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We thoroughly enjoyed this app and don\u2019t think the Drive to Hana would have been nearly as great without it! We had some connectivity issues with our rental car at first but eventually got the hang of it. We saw so many great sites that I doubt we would have found on our own. Two thumbs up! Highly recommend!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Found this doing a web search after my wife told me \u201cyou better study the book (Maui Revealed) good before we go on the road to Hana\u201d Poking through a book and writing down directions - didn\u2019t seem like great plan on a road that is known for cool stuff you could drive by and not know. So glad I bought this guide. Worth every single dime! The advice given, the history told as you drive along, cool local music and the split second directions like, \u201con your right .. that whole in the vines, ya bra, step through - it\u2019s a lava tube\u201d was dead on. And it gave you enough warning and even gave you solid advice about finding parking when you got close to these unmarked spots. The app helped find so many great sights! Super accurate working off my iPhone 7\u2019s GPS .. no cell service needed. When we come back to Maui, we\u2019ll defiantly do the other tours.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was perfect for our drive to Hana and back.  All the stops were timed perfectly and the commentary was great.  The history of the area was interesting and we were entertained by the narrator....even his corny anecdotes.  Worth the small price of the app.  Easy download and easy to set up through our car with Bluetooth. Don\u2019t try the drive without this!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The only issue we had was a few glitches in his speaking. Everything else was amazing with great recommendations.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"We had the best time in Maui thanks to Shaka. \nIt was just like having a local tour guide with us.\nI really recommend it.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We drove the road to Hana 5 years ago. I wish we had this app back then. It was so awesome to have the narrator give us step by step direction and with the greatest sense of humor! The app knew where we were and when we stopped so it was always at the right place. It also had some great stories about the island and its history. Definitely a must if you drive the road to Hana!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This idea should be a standard for any travel location in the world. \nGreat application. Highly recommended!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I can\u2019t imagine doing Hana without this guide.  Very informative, and very accurate. Without it we would have missed so much.  It tells you where to pullover, what to expect of road, what sights you might even want to give a pass if you\u2019re getting beauty exhaustion!  We did the full loop.  Like I said we saw some really great stuff we might have missed, like the lava tube and the old rubber plantation.  We were so glad we heard about it and bought it, enhanced our trip 100#!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Excellent app! Made our poorly planned toad to Hana experience feel like we had planned it for weeks! App has so many stops and features, people were stopping on the road asking us why we were stopping (lava cave specifically). Additionally, it was great knowing you had a map\/guide on the road when you don\u2019t have any cell service. Excellent app for HI guides.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great app!! Helped us with directions, food stops, restrooms and even making sure we were able to stay on track for what we wanted to accomplishment! The way back he told great stories and played great music! Really impressed with this app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Did the Hana loop guide and it was great-the GPS landmarks are spot on and it works without service after you download it to your phone","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I have been to Hana 5 times, but today I downloaded the app and did the Hana loop tour- it was uhhhhh-mazing!!! There were SO many things that I had missed on all of my other trips- I was completely blown away. I absolutely loved it!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We really enjoyed our Maui tours with Shaka Guide. The production value is really high with a great voice over, local music, sights, accommodations, history, Jokes. \n\nReally nice! I highly recommend it brah \ud83e\udd19","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I purchased this tour and made sure it had fully downloaded before I left the hotel. When I arrived at the Road to Hana, though, the app stated that the tour had not, in fact, downloaded. My cell service was too weak to download the app at that point, and I didn\u2019t want to make my entire caravan of cars turn around to go searching for cell service. I used the in-app messaging feature to ask for a refund, and the responder said there was nothing he could do. He suggested using Apple\u2019s \u201creport a problem\u201d feature, but the link he gave me directed me to contact the app owners. I\u2019m dissatisfied start to finish with this app.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Our friends told us about the app and said it was pretty cool.. they were right!!! The guide was fun both to our destination and on return. The stops were fantastic and breathtaking and we could stop or move on. Definitely worth it!! Mahalo \ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udf34","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great guide!  Good music, fun facts, and wonderful recommendations!  So happy to have found this app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We had a few technical difficulties with this at first, I think more related to our rental car\u2019s Bluetooth than the app, but we were able to play it thru a portable speaker that we brought for the beach. Once we got it going, it was great and really informative. The Shaka guide can be a bit cheesy now and then, yes, but the provided info is really interesting. There is simply no way we would have known what was coming up, how long until the next site, where restrooms were, etc. The linkage to your GPS is sooo nice since he can then give you a timely \u201cheads up\u201d for upcoming pullouts and turns. This is critical on this curvy little road. It was also really helpful to know how much time we had until we reached Hana and the \u201cend of the road\u201d up ahead. We stayed overnight in Hana and then did Oheo pools and Pipiwai trail early the next morning which I highly recommend to avoid the crowds. On the way back the guide gives a lot of interesting history of the islands that we really enjoyed. \n\nMy whole family made me promise to write a review since they felt that our drive was so enhanced by this guide, so here you go!  Mahalo!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Highly recommend the Loop. We thought the backside was more beautiful than the frontside. Small patch of dirt road & narrow patches, but, well worth it! The guide was perfect to follow all along the way; easy directions, entertaining narrator, useful tips! One suggestion would be to play continuous Hawaiian music along the way. App pays for itself with all the memories!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Such a helpful & fun app for Road to Hana! Worth every penny & then some. Was very useful, educational, & entertaining! So glad I went out in a limb & bought this; made for an awesome trip!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"If you\u2019re driving the road to Hana, this app is a MUST!!!! This will be your own private tour guide in the comfort of your own vehicle that leads you to all the highlights and hidden spots on the road. Enjoy!!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"For anyone wanting to do the road to Hana and Mt Haleakal\u0101 I highly recommend this app! It\u2019s great! We got to see everything we planned and more, nothing missed!!! It was great to do these trips ourselves without going on a bus tour (it\u2019s to peopley) and the hikes to the waterfalls were great!!! We went at our own pace, never feeling rushed!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Such an amazing app. We saw a ton we never would have seen without the tour. Absolutely worth the money!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Highly recommend this App, it was fantastic and made our journey on the Road to Hana so much better- worth every cent.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Very good - I don\u2019t do reviews often- this one is worth it. Cool music, great tips, pleasant voice - a bit of cheesy fun in there too.  It felt like a local was in the back seat. I feel bad for those that didn\u2019t have this and just \u201cdrove to Hana\u201d.  They misses so much.  FYI- bring off road shoes, bug repellent and sunscreen.  Have a blast!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Planning to just use google maps? DONT. Developers put their heart into this app. Features make it worth every penny. Firstly, without fail it works without any reception\/signal\/data and provides pinpoint, timely directions at every turn. Secondly, if you are running late (less than 10 hrs of daylight) the app even tells you what you should skip to optimize your trip. I got started late and the guides advice made it the best day of my Maui trip where I didn\u2019t feel like I missed out on anything! Waterfall swimming, beach, hiking, food; I got it all and started the drive at 10:30am! And lastly, it feels like the guy doing the voice guide really cares about you, your trip, and the island. Gives an amazing tour, not only by telling you the stops, but with extra stories\/history\/music (told with Hawaiian attitude) all along the way. Constant entertainment with a friendly local.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is everything. Once u get near Hana depending on ur phone carrier you don\u2019t really get a lot of signal. SM connects follows your gps so everything works just perfectly. \n\nSuper informative and I love how I got to know about Hawaii\u2019s history more than anything! \n\nI absolutely recommend this to everyone","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We really enjoyed the app for our Road to Hana trip. We got a late start and the app had built in must-see and skip if you\u2019re short on time suggestions. I would have liked instructions at the start that there are ample food trucks along the way. We stopped at the suggested sandwich spot at the start of the tour, but given the difficulty finding parking, and the wonderful smell of the BBQ further along the route, we would have rather stopped later. We loved the Hawaiian music and history the tour provides. Great app. I wish I could give 4.5 stars.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"This was the best app for someone who hits the road solo. The suggestions were perfect, there is a little humor and traditional island feel. Highly suggest you take Shakaguide to the road to Hana.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We loved the tour!! We liked recommendations for each trip point and also the history facts for the trip back. \nMahalo and Aloha Oe!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Came across this app on our trip to Maui and what a great purchase we made! We saw things because of this app that we would have drove right by! It\u2019s like having a tour guide with us in the car. Even told us where to park to get great views and where there were places to eat or find restrooms. Would definitely purchase again","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"If you are like me and you hate your guised you\u2019ll love this app! Although this is a self guided tour it feels extremely personable and has a no rush feel to it. I would highly recommend if you before you explore yourself instead of paying expensive tour prices.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Can\u2019t get it to download. It stopped at 2% and I\u2019ve tried everything. Paid for this app even. Very discouraged","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Works like a charm!!  Works great. Only suggestion would be more and better Hawaiian music in downtimes.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I wish the app could somehow give you play by play weather and road condition updates.   \nWe didn\u2019t make it to Hana today because we went the back route and spent a lot of time at the various sites not knowing that rain was moving in quickly and a subsequent wash out would happen prohibiting our passage to Hana.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Couldn\u2019t have made the trip without it.  You have no idea about most of the sights along the road. And off the road.  It is a truly excellent guide.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The Shaka Guide 100% made this trip better. We had a blast stopping at all the recommended spots and learning a little history along the way. What a great day around the island. \n\nMet several folks back at the resort that took the Road to Hana without the Shaka Guide and they didn\u2019t like it. Said it was boring, no signs of where to stop, and felt like they just spent 8 hours in the car. \n\nIf you\u2019re planning on the Road to Hana, Shaka Guide is a must!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app made our Road to Hana trip the best! Highly recommend! Not sure how we would have put our stops together without it, but wouldn\u2019t have been this good. It even saved us when we stayed out a bit too long and ran into a road closure trying to do the full loop. We used it as a map to guide us back in the dark, raining, in a thunderstorm, and read off the markers for some peace of mind as we weren\u2019t familiar with the road.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was helpful from start to finish! If you drive through road to Hana on your own, I would highly recommend this app. It gives you the entire detailed route with highlights of the spots you should check out and which ones to skip over. We rented our own car and completed the classic tour which takes you through it and back and enjoyed it.  A guided professional tour starts in the $100\u2019s, I would\u2019ve paid more than double for these guided tours because of what they have to offer. You go at your own pace, bring a car charger!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The road to H\u0101na was a beautiful and mostly relaxing drive. Do use causation though. Pay attention to the weather because it turns fast and you don\u2019t want to get stuck on the H\u0101na Hwy in a rain of biblical levels.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The best app ever!!!!! We loved this app and would have missed so much if we didn\u2019t have it. I rate it a 10 +. Do yourself a favor and get this app, you won\u2019t be disappointed.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We only learned about this app while staying in H\u0101na, and only heard the return portion. But was totally worth it. And looking forward to using the app for our next trip to Maui.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is by far the best one I have found for the road to Hana! The history and stop-by-stop guide is second to none. We would have missed some amazing stops if it wasn\u2019t for Shaka Guide. The guide is funny and extremely informative. I am already looking to purchase the other tours!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Awesome App!!!! Highly recommend it if you\u2019re doing the Road to Hana.  It\u2019s like you have your own personal Hawaiin local in the car with you telling you every twist & turn & where to stop from restrooms to breath taking hikes to beautiful water falls.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was a helpful guide to a long day of driving and sightseeing. It gave us lots of options for things to see and do with great directions. Highly recommend.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"After purchasing the tours in app, I downloaded all the necessary downloads then forgot about it for two days. The night before my actual drive, I opened the app and saw that all my downloads were gone. That was strange, but maybe my fault, so I started the downloads and went to bed. This morning I opened the app to find that nothing had downloaded. I downloaded again. 30 minutes later I reopened the app to find all my downloads gone and the app re-downloading content for a third time\u2014on my cellular connection. I can\u2019t count on this for the road to hana. You might not want to either.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Could not imagine doing this trip without your app. It is super duper great!! Friend of ours told us about it before our trip to the island, and boy, we are glad we remembered it! We had to quickly reroute back to the hotel to use their Wi-Fi so we don\u2019t blow our data cap. But it\u2019s worth it. The information and the humor of the narrator are awesome!! We learned a lot about this tour, island and Hawaii in general. Will recommend this to our friends!! Mahalo!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Very helpful, friendly and informative. Highly recommended. It made our day way funnier than we expected.

{"body":"Took us to all the great places, and explained exactly where they were and where to park. We especially loved the Red Sand beach in Hana and the Venus pool (wear your swimsuit!). Would recommend updating the app tho, as the Seven Sacred Pools at the end are 1) gross and 2) closed, and have been since January 2017. Other than that, everything was perfect!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Shaka Guide was recommended by a friend in lieu of paying hundreds of dollars to a guide. My wife and I loved the ease of use, information, and humor of this app - it helped us have a memorable adventure. Highly recommended.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was great! We wanted to see as much of the island as possible and this app for sure made that happen. Just be sure to go a little slower, some of the stops and trail heads are hard to spot \ud83d\ude09","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was worth every penny. It takes all of the work and STRESS out of researching the extensive RTH and Haleakal\u0101 trips! What a fun, interactive experience. We loved our Shaka tour guide, and even met some others on the road who also used it!!! The guide was helpful, funny, and informative. We learned so much and had a great time. I cannot underscore enough just how stress-free this app made our Maui experience. Thank you, Shaka Guide!! I will look to this company for future trips to Hawaii.

Especially loved the swimming hole and falls off of the water co. access road!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We used these guides for the Road to Hana and for Haleakala National Park. Both were excellent and indispensable, particularly the guide for the Road to Hana. The guides contained accurate, easy-to-follow directions and tips on how to best use your time and what attractions were worth seeing. They also contained great background information and history. The narration made the drives go fast  and enjoyably. Highly recommended.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My husband and I traveled the Road to Hana today on Maui. Not having a real plan, we downloaded this app. It was fantastic filled with great information! The app suggested sites to see but also told you better ones if we didn\u2019t have time to make all the stops. Loved all the other info it provided about sites and history. I\u2019ll use this app again!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I had heard about this app from a YouTube video and from a guide to see sunrise on Haleakal\u0101 highly recommended this app. We did the complete Hana loop around and it was great to hear about upcoming highlights and the Hawaiian music, plus gave us confidence to complete the back side of the loop! And the backside was SO worth it, just breathtaking!! Can\u2019t imagine doing the loop with out this app! So much add value to my trip, Thank You!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Was very skeptical on buying this app thought we wouldn\u2019t need it but by the end of the trip we were so glad we had it! Best decision ever!!! The app says to go to black sand beach.. don\u2019t do it.. very disappointing","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The Shaka Maui app was seriously on point with every tip, driving direction, and time management help. Not only did Shaka Maui help us see things we didn\u2019t know existed,  but it was also entertaining and educational. The whole group laughed, learned a lot about the history of Maui, and thoroughly enjoyed the Hawaiian music.  \n\nShaka Maui will always be my go to for touring the islands and was worth every penny!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This made our family\u2019s Road to Hana experience! We hooked it up to our rental van\u2019s auxiliary input and we all listened the entire day.

Very, very worth the money and highly recommended!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"It\u2019s amazing how far technology has come. This was like being on a guided tour. Worked flawlessly on My iPhone X, the narration was excellent, timing was precise, just a well made app. Worth every cent of the $14 I paid for the tours. You\u2019re doing yourself a huge disservice if you drive Hana road without this app. Mahalo for taking the time and creating the best Hana drive experience out there.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was a great addition to our road to Hana tour. We would have missed mostly everything we were able to see without it.we also learned a lot about Hawaiian history and culture thAt we didn\u2019t know before. The only reason I didn\u2019t rate a 5 was because After completely downloading it, when I got ready to use it had me to download it again. Thanks so much!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"This app worked fantastic. We saw so many more things in the road to Hana than our previous two trips. It is easy to use and packed with lots of tips and exact locations of sites you would drive right past without this app. I thought my teen boys would think it was too corny but they loved it too. So much that my oldest suggested the app for Out Oahu trip also.  Thanks for great guided tours!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We used this guide recently on the Road to Hana. The guide (we called him Buddy) gave us great info on the trip with lots of useful tips. Highly recommend.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We just finished the tour to Hana and the app was a great help because it helped us get to very beautiful places with ease. The only reason why I didn\u2019t rate the app with 5 stars is because I don\u2019t agree with the description of the people from the area. Even though the entire island depends on the tourism industry, the residents of Hana are not friendly and they make sure that you leave with the impression that you\u2019re not welcome in their land. \nGreat app, nice place but I\u2019m not coming back","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"This app was a huge hit with our teenager, who usually makes fun of most things like this. Even I, who was skeptical, enjoyed it. The narrator really brought the aloha spirit into our car and made the drive to Hana so much easier. We loved the history, details, and mellow vibe of Shaka Guide. I can\u2019t imagine how we survived without it when we visited 25 years ago.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I was reluctant to purchase, but I\u2019m so glad I did. This was incredible. It gives you places to go, places to skip and all kinds of trivia and helpful information. I had a way better time because of this app. If you are going to Hana this is a must have.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

We highly recommend it for anyone contemplating the road to Hana.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"So helpful.  So accurate.  Would have missed a lot if we didn\u2019t have this guide.  So easy to start, stop, and skip things that didn\u2019t interest us.  For a few dollars, this guide is a MUST.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"As two tourists from New York City who\u2019d never been to Hawaii before, I\u2019m pretty sure this drive would have been impossible without this app. We downloaded the \u201cClassic\u201d tour, and because of this app we were able to budget our time on the road and made sure we stopped at all of the essential detours (and skipped the ones he said may not be worth it), while still getting back to our hotel in Kihei before sundown. The app worked seamlessly with our car\u2019s GPS. He tells you all the turns to make and the backroads to take, and he never missed once! Where the restrooms are, which food trucks to stop at. It can be so specific that he\u2019ll tell you where to turn for the best banana bread, and he\u2019s right! It WAS the best! The guy\u2019s got major personality too. We\u2019re still talking like him, \u201cbrah!\u201d And make sure to leave the tour on for the ride home. He takes you through the entire history of Hawaii and King Kamehaha and you just learn so much and see so many beautiful things that it\u2019s hard to put into words. Mahalo for an incredible experience!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The residents of Maui do not appreciate your encouraging visitors to tromp onto private and sacred lands. All of the trails along the road to Hana area on private land and therefore you are promoting illegal trespassing. This app has created such congestion at all pullouts along Hana hwy it hardly makes it worth seeing for those who live here or just discovered the beauty of the NE shore on there own. \nIt\u2019s unfortunate you profit from ruining a sacred part of paradise.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Great app that allows you to experience The Road to Hana at your own pace and that also allows you to choose your own adventure. Super easy to use giving you plenty of time to locate indicates attractions. Also provides interesting history facts along the way.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is a great app. On the way there they go over all the best spots and smartly encourage you to skip over some of the early spots to make sure you make it to the end. The cheesiness is so fun too, and on the way home they tell you stories of the history of Hawaii!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great tour guide to Hana app.  It felt like we had our own personal guide tour.  Def worth the money and it\u2019s better than paying for an actually tour guide.  I highly recommend this app.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app changes the way we take adventures and sight see, for the better. Everything is from a local experience and on your own time. They give you instructions and options. The app even plays music and it was perfect on our road to Hana. It made our experience and we can\u2019t wait to use it again and again. Which we can now that we bought the bundle deal, which was $6 cheaper than the traditional cd and map. I couldn\u2019t imagine looking at a map while trying to take everything in. We learned a lot! Great idea! Thank you! I am telling everyone I know who comes to Maui. \u201cYou need Shaka Guide to have the best time.\u201d","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I downloaded both online and complete tour maps and they both constantly said they would need to download again after already downloading for over 30 mins. Did not get to use this app on my trip and I would like a refund.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"My wife and almost didn\u2019t buy this app because the preview sounded like an obnoxious sales pitch. But this app was the most worthwhile while purchase we made while in Muai (and believe me we purchased a lot of amazing food).\nThe information is fun, informative, interesting, and up to date. It\u2019s like listening to a geo-positional podcast. If you are driving to Hana pay the $8 - whoever developed this app clearly spent a lot of time and thought putting this together. My only regret is not discovering this app before we drove up Haleakala.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Used this app today, hands down a must have for this drive!!! Guided us through the entire drive giving us a little history and making sure, we got through our journey safe...\n\nI don\u2019t know how they do it? Didn\u2019t even have cell service for a good portion of the drive, but app was on point the entire route. \n\nLastly, definitely use the app for the drive back. It\u2019s a long drive and this helps break of the monotony of 1200+ curves!\n\nBe sure to download before hitting the road \ud83d\ude09\n\nGet this. You won\u2019t be disappointed...!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The app worked perfectly the entire trip. Without this app we would have been guessing all day on where to go and what to do. There is no cell service the entire trip basically and this app worked the whole trip.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app made the road to Hana so much fun and so easy. The guy who did all of the narration did such a great job adding places to stop along with history about the place and about Hawaii. The app tells you so many places you can see and helps you know which ones you really want to stop at. I highly recommended this app.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Very accurate with the GPS. \n\nDidn\u2019t interact well with iTunes.  Kept going back to the beginning of the same song annoying\n\nThe voice over as a bite goofy.  Too much island bro. \n\nThe island history stories were very interesting. \n\nWould have liked the option to just have Hawaiian music during the time fronmpoint to point when there was no dialog.  \nTheir choice of music was very good.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"Aloha!\n\nMy wife and I decided to take the Road to Hana Loop during our 10 day stay on Maui. It was absolutely incredible. Our tour guide was absolutely on point with every turn, highlight and even the areas not so great.

Thank you so much and I would highly recommended to anyone on the island of Maui. \n\nShaka Brah!\n\nZK&B","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is amazing. Finds little things on the side of the road I would never have found myself (lava tubes). Tells you exactly where to park, where to go and what to expect for over 100 sites. We also listened to the R2H cd from our hotel and this blew it out of the water!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Shaka Guide is a must have if you\u2019re doing a self-guided Road to Hana tour! It was fun, creative and we loved the cultural background information during the tour. All the \u201cmust see\u201d spots are covered and they recommend places to skip if you\u2019re cutting close on time - this was extremely helpful! Overall, it took out all the stress in planning for the tour and really allowed us to enjoy the beauty of the drive. Download for your next adventure!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"We heard stories about how \u201chard\u201d the road to Hana was and that it wasn\u2019t worth the time spent. We did a snorkeling tour on Redline Tours and one of the guides, Tevye, said the Road to Hana was worth the trip but you have to get the Shaka App. We did and we loved every minute of the tour. Not only did we find the \u201ctreasures\u201d in the beautiful scenery, but we learned Hawaiian history and culture. We will do the road to Hana again and take our new found Shaka friend with us.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My husband and I used this app to drive to and from Hana. Not only was the app entertaining but very useful in navigating the best places to stop (and teaching us lots of Hawaiian history).  Highly recommend.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Thank you for the reverse Road to Hana self guided tour.  It made it very easy & we saw lots of amazing scenery!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Amazing self tour guide. My wife and I used the app to take us to the summit of Haleakal\u0101. It well worth the money! We got lots of great information and made us feel comfortable on the long journey! We would highly recommend this guide if you\u2019re going on any of the trips the app supports.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My husband and I used this app on our trip to Maui. We had no idea what to expect and thought we could just \u201cwing it.\u201d This app exceeded expectations for an adventurous couple as us.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We just used the Classic Road to Hana tour and it was great!  I can\u2019t imagine doing the tour without an app like this.  The directions were great and gave timely advice (enough lead time to make an educated decision).  I would use it again in a heartbeat.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Okay, was a little skeptical before purchasing. But cannot be happier now! This tour was AMAZING! I did some of my own research before coming and thought I found some great hidden and local spots. This tour hit ALL of those points and so much more! I NEVER write reviews (literally EVER) but this was just so amazing and worth it, that I felt the need to do it. So happy to be a part of this tour, and saw some absolutely amazing sights and views. Couldn\u2019t have asked for anything better! MAHAOLO!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Downloaded and installed this app due to overwhelming recommendations by people who drove the Road to Hana. It\u2019s the best $7.99 purchase of our trip. Cellphone signal (I had sprint, hubby has T-Mobile) very spotty thanks to this app we need not worry about that. We found some gems we would\u2019ve otherwise drove by and learned so much about history and local customs, in addition to the must-stop mile markers. If you have to choose between this and the Maui guidebook, save yourself the nausea and keep your eyes free to enjoy the most beautiful coastal drive in the pacific\u2014get this!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My wife and I took the self guided tour. For the price there\u2019s no way you can beat this deal, you will be very well informed with local information about everything you drive by. You must plan for a whole day maybe even two days to get everything completed on the app. The only downfall was some silence between some of the stops. I would have liked Hawaii music throughout the whole duration of the trip. Over all very well laid out and enjoyable for the whole family this app is a MUST when visiting Hawaii.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was the perfect outline for our trip. We skipped the stops we weren\u2019t interested in but for the most part, this tour pretty much covered all our items on our list. Good parking tips and suggestions for each stop.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"A VP at work learned I was going to Hawaii and highly recommend Shaka Guide.  I read Hawaii travel reviews, but I didn\u2019t have the confidence that I had a thorough plan so I gave it a shot. This is the best app I\u2019ve ever used. It took me a little getting used to at first, but after the initial orientation, it was so simple and helpful. I downloaded 2 tours and that gave me 4 days of fun!  The guides cover major stops with bonus gems, plus included a lot of background and history of the island. There were stops and recommendations that I hadn\u2019t seen on travel sites that made the trip special.  This app will save you hours of planning and put you on your way to a fun-packed vacation. I can\u2019t recommend Shaka Guide enough.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Loved having this very timely narration, GPS, and great Oahu information at a very fair app price. Wish I had this for other road trips that I\u2019ve gone on.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I paid $9.99 for nothing, I uploaded it so I can do around the island with my visitors but it left me circling around Waikiki and it\u2019s frustrating.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"My husband and I downloaded this on our first trip to O\u2019ahu.  It was perfect.  We did both the Circle Island tour and South Island tour.  Both were amazing.  We have taken bus tours before and decided to sightsee on our own.  This app was perfect in that the directions are impeccable and the information provided is very interesting and worthwhile.  We will be looking for these downloads going forward when visiting the islands.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We had such a great time using the Shaka guide.  We did both tours and enjoyed the stories and points of interest.   Would recommend to anyone that do not want to pay the high price tour companies and enjoy going at your own pace.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We rented a Jeep and made our way around Oahu using this app. The directions were spot on and the landmarks were awesome. We loved learning about the history and culture of the Island. Without this app we wouldn\u2019t have known where to stop or what we were looking at. I\u2019d definitely download any of their tours in the future.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is such a good idea. We used the app and throughly enjoyed the sights and info along the route. I took off one star because while you can join the tour from anywhere which is really nice, you must go sequential order for the commentary and directions to work. We ended up circling the island clockwise starting at Waikiki, so since the narrative wouldn\u2019t work going that way, I just read the info on the different points of interest. \n\nAll in all a really nice app. I definitely recommend buying both tours to capture the whole island.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"If you like a road trip, don\u2019t try doing one in Hawaii without Shaka Guide. We used 3 apps on Big Island, Maui and Oahu. Easy to follow directions, fun and informative. We saw many hidden treasure we would\u2019ve been sure to have missed if we\u2019d have gone at it alone. The food recommendations ensured we had \u2018ono grinds and by our 8th tour we were even singing along to some of the tunes and testing one another on the local legends!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We couldn\u2019t decide between taking a guided tour around the North Shore of Oahu or driving it ourselves.  We like hearing the stories of a tour guide but also wanted to meander on our own terms, especially after doing a couple tour groups in Maui where the driving is harder (Road to Hana!).  Anyway, this app was perfect for us to split the difference and see things\/learn things we would have missed on our own but still go at our own pace and decide which stops to make for our interests.  Great investment for our trip!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Very good site seeing tips, directions, history, local information, music and humor. Would be nice if you could drive the trip either direction and not just counter clockwise, but it\u2019s probably a better passenger experience to do it counter clockwise and maybe less turns across traffic?","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I randomly downloaded Shaka Guide after finding it on Google. We didn\u2019t have any plans for our visit to Oahu other than to enjoy our visit. App was totally worth it! We bought both tours. I couldn\u2019t believe the precision in the tours and the clear directions on when\/where to turn. Not to mention the stories and hidden gems. When we return to explore the other islands we will definitely get the next guide!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was totally worth the money! We enjoyed the information and the fun way it was presented. We saw and learned many things we would have otherwise missed. A fun way to tour the island on our time with no limitations or schedules!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"What a wonderful two days we had exploring the beautiful Island of Oahu using the Shaka Guide. We experienced beautiful beaches, waterfalls, mountains, extinct volcanoes, and much more following the guides. We enjoyed delicious food stops and seemingly out of the way attractions. I would highly recommend the app.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We did the South Shore guide and it was great. The voice keeps you entertained and shows you spots that normally you would miss.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We purchased this app in order to tour the Oahu island and we were not disappointed.  It was my first time on the island and I have no sense of direction but this app easily guided me around Oahu.  The app not only gives  driving directions but also gives you history about Oahu and specific landmarks.  It\u2019s literally like having a personal tour guide.  I LOVED THIS APP and would definitely recommend to anyone.  It was well worth my money!!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Had no idea what to expect. It was awesome. We did the circle tour in about 5 hours, skipping many of the stops, so if you plan to do the stops, plan for a lot of time. The narration while driving worked great - like he was in the car with us. We fell in love with the narrator - we would have happily bought a chocolate pie for him like he requested!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Awesome experience.. got to see places that I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise. I truly enjoyed the history behind places. \nOnly suggestion I could think of is may be if you can trace when we go off track and suggest to come back to tour road, that\u2019d be helpful. We took wrongs turns couple of times and didn\u2019t realize. It wasn\u2019t until I saw the map that I realized that we weren\u2019t on the tour road. If shaka app could\u2019ve recognized that, it might\u2019ve saved us some time! \nI absolutely recommend this app. I will be trying more Maui tours in next few days - looking forward to it!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"While I was in Hawaii I could see I got charged for the map.  Asked for help which was sorry we can\u2019t.  Then the map showed up once I was back in Nebraska.  Too little, too late.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"This was our second \u201ccircle the island\u201d tour.  The first, a few years back with a tour company in a crowded bus on their rushed schedule. This time, we rented a car, downloaded this app and set off like we were old pros!  This app made the tour so much fun! The guidance was spot on, the narration was lively and informative. We enjoyed our day very much, spending about nine hours just doing what we wanted, when we wanted.  The only negative, completely out of the developers control, is that the road to the royal birthing stones is now gated with a huge no trespassing sign.  We wanted to see this, but missing it in no way distracts from this amazing tour!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Learned about Shaka guide thru a local mom I met at the park. This is our third time on the island and we got to visit some many spots. Best part was stopping at all the different beaches, stores, food spots along the way. Took about the entire day and the kids (8,7,4) had no complaints!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Shaka guide was absolutely the best. I wish we could do more of the available tours. We tried Maui, Road to Hana and Oahu, Northshore. The guide was very informative and very precise. Perfect direction and appropriate advice. The jokes and music were tasteful. I only wish there was more informative passages. We really enjoyed anecdotes and history bits. It seems that there is room for more of it in the guide. Once again, excellent app. I am looking forward to different guides. And different cities.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I\u2019m not gonna lie I started to cry the first 30 min of my drive. The narrator was epic in so many ways. He was on point with the humor and amazing with the history. It was all the stuff i wanted to know and none of the stuff i didn\u2019t need to know. \nThe food suggestions rocked. And the gps instructions worked so well! I was nervous it wouldn\u2019t work well but man they did good! \nI even loved the music in between! Wish there was more! But it was so good!!!! \n\nSuch a good app for the solo traveler that rents a car no saved so much money doing this rather than going on a tour :)","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We used this app today to do\nCircle island tour on Oahu. We had an amazing day! We sat at dinner after our trip and discussed all the fun facts we\nLearned on our journey. Save yourself some money from high dollar tours and get this app!! We all agreed that this app made our day and lead us on a great tour when giving us some great historical information about Hawaii. Highly recommend.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The navigation was unbelievably accurate and easy.  The narration was great and filled with lots of history and legends.  Stops were great highlights of the island.  We rented a car for just one day and used this app to navigate a fun ten hour day.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great app. Only issue is we found many things were not open on Sunday, so if you really want to see something check their hours in advance.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I purchased both Oahu circle tours. I used them recently on our trip to Oahu. It was my husband\u2019s first time to the island and it had been 35 years since my last trip. I liked the idea of a circle tour, but did not want to spend my time on a tour bus. \n\nEven though we ran out of time and didn\u2019t get to do the whole tour, it was perfect for our needs. Best part is being able to go at your own pace, in your own car, and stop for what interests you, while passing by what does not. \n\nWe look forward to our next trip so we can use the app and see more of the circle tour.\n\nPS\u2014make sure you bring along a car charger for your phone.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"After a couple days at the resort we wanted to explore the island. Rented a cat and downloaded Oahu full circle. The app synced up with car audio easily and automatically via usb cord and Apple play. App gps picked up our location and gave great directions to the tour starting point. \nWe left the app running the entire time with via a power cord via usb and Apple play running all day the phone stayed charged and the tour guide with his island trivia interspersed perfectly with silence and island music and fantastic gps and audio directions.\nI can not recommend this highly enough. My entire family listened intently most of the time and we got to pick and choose what we wanted to do along the way spending as much or as little time as we wanted along the way. Definitely do this app and tour. Mahalo from first time Texas visitor!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Because traffic is horrible on this island you need to figure out how to make the tour work in whatever direction you can reasonably go.  It\u2019s presumptuous to believe one direction is best 24\/7 on this island.  $7 blown \u2639\ufe0f","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"We started out this app near the airport. \n\nTip A. Starting out \n\n1.The app is going to ask you which starting point you\u2019re close to. You can click on \u201cother\u201d, if you\u2019re nowhere near a starting point or if you\u2019re (like us) already traveled parts of the island) \n\n2. Find a point\/ number closest to you\u2019d like to visit. Remember to find a number that will continue onto the direction you want. Find the same spot on your navigation (we used google maps).\n\n3. Reach that point and voila! You can start your tour from that point on. \n\nVery happy that the app showed us the arch and that hill that overlooked Waimea. We came during the winter so we caught some sweet north shore waves (on camera ha!).  Turtle bay parking was a bit impossible for us unfortunately. But we heard turtles go on shore at lunch time. \n\nGood luck! Great app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We used the app and drove all around the island. It only took a few minutes to figure it out. We had planned to take a $60 pp bus tour but found this app and decided to self drive instead. \n\nOnly one problem\/annoyance and I think it might be more of an iPhone issue than an app issue. The phone was plugged into the USB port with a lightning cable.  I had my wife and her mom with me. The app ALWAYS tried to play my (rock and roll) music in-between narration and I could not shut off my music. \nWe finally had to unplug and use the phones speaker so it wouldn\u2019t keep starting my music after each audio clip.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Wonderful! Fantastic! Great!  I, with my 2 young adult children, took this tour our first day on the island to get familiar with the \u2018layout\u2019.  The \u2018guide\u2019 was fun, very informative, easy voice, etc. We fell in love with him. The driving instructions are very detailed & easy to follow. We laughed each time he told us \u2018good job\u2019 after completing a turn or a merge etc. (not annoying he didn\u2019t over do it). My children handled the technical stuff - very easy & there were no tech issues. We stopped at some sites and bypassed some. Each time we got back in car it started right where it should. And it was easy to jump ahead or go back. Again, the guide was perfect, the \u2018stories\u2019 and information were very good. And it was nice because he wasn\u2019t talking the whole time. This app is a gem and you can\u2019t beat the price!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Even tho I have been here before, and seen most of the guide locations, this time I was bringing family who haven\u2019t been here before. Instead of doing all the work and looking up addresses for locations and hoping I didn\u2019t miss something. This is a step by step private tour guide to take you to every stop. (We even named ours \u201cTim\u201d) Even hit some tour spots I had never done before, so an added bonus! Well worth the money.  Mahalo!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We didn\u2019t want to be tied to a tour bus schedule...after a quick search we found this app. We got to see great sites on the south shore tour, spend as little or long as we wanted at each one and learned some great history we would not have learned if we would have just headed out without Shaka Guide!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We see if the South island and circle tours both.  They were both great.  We had the best time and appreciated the guide and enjoyed every stop. Highly recommend.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I never, ever pay for apps. Like, not even $0.99. This one was $13.99 and worth all of it. The guide was spot on without being too chatty, and got us to soooo many cool places we wouldn\u2019t have gotten to on our own. If you\u2019re going to one of the islands, absolutely download this app and buy the tour package","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great way to see the island! Directions are spot on, commentary is interesting, and we saw so many interesting sites. Thank you Shaka!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Maybe I am slow but thought wherever I was it would start up. I couldn\u2019t get it to work as I headed the wrong way to north shore and it wasn\u2019t until I cussed a bit and turned back that the app started talking to me!  I wish I knew up front which direction you have to go.  It would be nice for the app to just start where you are at and whatever direction you wanted to travel.  We loved the south shore tour as we had not gone that way before.  Well worth the money","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We had decided to tour the island of Oahu, and were looking at various tour companies. The prices were at least $89 and upward of $120+ per person. Instead we rented a car for the day in Waikiki, set out on our own and followed the Oahu Circle Tour. It was more than we hoped for. The guide was informative and fun. We saw things I\u2019d never seen before on island. And we loved the historical information. The music was wonderful. We sang a lot of the songs, people in our car were 18-75 years old, and we all loved it. In fact we were sad when it was over. We all feel like we made a friend with the narrator. \n\nOf note, we avoided the Polynesian Cultural Center (not my cup of tea), and it was still a full day, from 8am-6pm. We did a detour at KoHana Rum Distillery for a tasting and that should be included, because it was amazing. The distillery talks about history of the area, the importance of sugar cane to the Hawaii, and the types of rum. Plus they gave us samples of chocolate, sugar cane juice, honey, and of course rum. Just a recommendation.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We moved to Honolulu last month and our adult son came to visit for Thanksgiving this week. We got the Oahu tour set and it was a really fun way to learn about the Island as we drove around. Nicely done!  The narrator has a lot of personality and was both entertaining and informative. The app worked flawlessly. One thought: I\u2019d love it if there was a way to have the music be continuous. there were often long silences between cues.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We spent a day on the Oahu North tour, and we loved the experience. It was fun, informative, and we finished the trip wishing we had a Shaka guide for all the places we went to. Great concept, excellent execution, expand!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This tour covered all the sights with turn by turn directions as well as stories, history and music. Well worth the law cost","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I had read an article or heard from a friend about this app and we decided to try it out. This is our fourth trip to O\u2019ahu and we saw things we have never heard about or have seen before. We did both tours and even my 12 year old son who was initially against it couldn\u2019t believe how fun it was and couldn\u2019t wait to do the second one. Thanks for creating these and keep making them! Great concept and fun way to see the highlights of the island!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We were hesitant about getting this app but decided to just pay the $7 to try it and we were so glad we did. Not only did we learn about Hawaii but we saw things we never would\u2019ve otherwise. Definitely a must to tour the island. We plan on using it in kauai","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We were skeptical when we downloaded but had an amazing time. Discovered many things that we wouldn\u2019t have on our own. One tip: use your GPS to drive to first point on the trip. From there the app will pick up based on your GPS coordinates. Initially I thought app will pickup my location and start giving directions. That\u2019s not the case. \n\nHighly recommended!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Wow! I did the South Shore tour and afterwards asked local friends if they knew the some of places the tour took me to and they were amazed saying, \u201cLived here all my life and didn\u2019t know those spots!\u201d I can\u2019t wait to get back and do the Circle Tour.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"We traveled to Oahu and thought we would try the app out. Michael stayed with us on the app and helped facilitate the ins and outs of using the app. We found things on Oahu that we hadn\u2019t discovered before on a previous trip. If it wasn\u2019t for this app we would not have known about the extras. It\u2019s an awesome app can\u2019t wait to use it again. Mahalo!!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app made our first visit to the islands a breeze! The navigation is easy to understand and the tour allows you to experience the Island at your own pace and budget- I can\u2019t recommend this app enough- it\u2019s pretty darn near perfect!!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I used this for multiple days to explore the island. It was super easy to use. So many fantastic sights to see. You can skip some or go to them all. I loved the narrative too. The guide was easy to listen too and full of very interesting details. It is easy to start from the pre-determined spots or to join from anyplace in Oahu. The driving directions were easy to follow too.  This app is well worth the price. I will be downloading for other islands too","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We had a little difficulty with using the app in the beginning, but we learned how to get to use it along the way. It was a scenic drive for the most and we got allot of pictures and memories :-)","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I stumbled across an ad for this app soon after arriving in Oahu and it was the highlight of our trip!  We did both tours and can\u2019t say enough about how great it was! I am a serious trip planner, and the app took us to everything I had planned and more. Normally when traveling, my husband drives while I navigate from my travel books, notes, and maps in my lap. But, this was a girls trip where I was the driver, and the app made the best copilot! Thank you Shaka guide! My friends and I will definitely recommend your app and we will use again if we return to the islands! Mahalo!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The places suggested were all fun to stop by and check out. The guide would also provide context and history into each of the stops so you have some appreciation of the location. Also, I loved the musical highlights of local artists long the drive. Definitely put us in the Aloha Spirit!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Having never been to Oahu before we wanted a guided tour of the island without the rush of a group on a schedule. This app is perfect and did everything and more.  We will definitely use Shaka when we visit the other islands","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was amazing. Is it incredibly easy to follow. It took you everywhere you needed to go. When you start it didn\u2019t matter how long you were stopped. It picked right back up. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a self guided tour of any of the islands. Rent a car, get the app, and have a ball.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great app!! It\u2019s tells you about the history of the places, spots to eat, beaches, famous points.\nDefinitely recommend!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

Driving was easy with better instructions than google.  We\u2019ve told everyone about it!   Loved loved loved it!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was absolutely amazing and helped make for one of our best days on the island.

This app was perfect for pointing out all of the best places for us to stop and enjoy the trip!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My wife and I did the Oahu South Shore tour and absolutely loved the app. It truly was like having a tour guide in the car with us! We did the tour at our leisure and saw and lots of cool places we NEVER would have found on our own. One of the best vacation days ever! We\u2019re doing the Circle Island tour later in the week and can\u2019t wait!\n\nArnie\/Carla","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Had 6 hours to kill after a conference and before the long flight home. Found this app, downloaded it, rented a car, and hit the road. The tips and guided instructions were great. We didn\u2019t get to experience the full tour but the app and our guide kept up and we learned a bunch on our drive. Highly recommend if you want to see Oahu and want the freedom to go at your own pace.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"If you rent a car when visiting Hawaii, you can\u2019t go wrong with these tours. We had a short time here, and wanted to see as much as the island as we could. It felt like the narrator was riding in the car with us! We stayed on Oahu and saw so many amazing things, that we didn\u2019t even know existed! Truly a fantastic app at an even better price. Everyone we bumped into here and asked about the app was truly impressed, and planned on getting the app for themselves. Thanks For making our Oahu vacation that much better!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"If you want to explore the island on your schedule this is the best way to go. So much to see. Lots of locals only spots and even food stops. Loved every minute of it and without it I would not have known where to go. Now if only it would be in Spanish as well. It would be easier to recommend to my Spanish speaking friends. Mahalo!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I picked this app because it was made by people who live in Hawaii. It was great right from the start. This was my third trip to Oahu. This time we brought our two teen boys. I was afraid they would tire of the app with the corny jokes but they loved. I saw so much of the island I had completely missed on my past trips. The boys enjoyed it so much they wanted to do another tour the next day. The tips about food stops, snorkel spots and great views was priceless. And the luxury of being in your own car and not tied to a big group schedule was perfect. We even used the all to go back to some spots for more time on other days. I immediately recommended the app to a friend traveling the following week. \nDon\u2019t miss out like I did on my first two visits, get this app and see so much more!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Each tour segment is practically identical to the others. Tours do not include West Oahu. Disappointment. Edit> I\u2019ve  lived on Oahu for 14 years. Segments of the guide include tours that are already covered. Where is West Oahu covered?","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Can not say enough good things about this app! My girlfriend and I did the circle island tour and the south shore tour ! Both were absolutely amazing, it literally is like having a tour guide in ur car ! The directions are spot on. This app will help you make the most of your time here in Hawaii. I promise you won\u2019t be disappointed. The only thing i suggest is to download them before your trip !! Or make sure your place has good WiFi. Once there downloaded ur good to go! Can\u2019t wait to go to the other islands and do the other tours !","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My husband and I rented a Jeep. We downloaded the Shaka App so we can tour on our own. We don\u2019t really do the touring with groups thing because we like to venture off and do our own thing. The GPS signal on this app was incredibly accurate. I felt guided the entire time! The app tells you where to go, historical stories and plays songs along the way, Mahalo!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app provides very clear directions and tips to find great things to see in Oahu.  We did the South shore tour and the northern circle tour and loved both.  Great way to see the sites on your own timeline.  Highly recommend. Note that you can start the tour at any point on the map, but it only works in one direction. You cant go through the points in reverse direction","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My family and I really had a great time taking this tour. Saw parts of the island we never would have without the guidance of the app. Well worth the $7","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Mahalo for the best app ever.  We took both tours around Oahu and had the best time.  This is my third time on the island, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s first.  He saw more in a couple of days, than I saw in all my other times.  We were both impressed with all of the history of what we were seeing, as well as the music played.  Thank goodness I found this, and didn\u2019t pay some tour company $125 a piece for theirs. We loved being on our timetable, and being able to stay places as long as we wanted, or just move on, if it didn\u2019t interest us.  We will definitely use the other apps in the future, when visiting other islands.  Wonderful job, guys.  We recommend that everyone use this.  It\u2019s affordable, and very well worth a look.  Especially if you are trying to see the whole island in the most affordable way ever.  \ud83c\udf34\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udfc4\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"The first time we came to Oahu we hired a private driver to shows us the island. This time I used the ShakaGuide for the South Shore and the Circle of the Island.  I saw, learned and gained so much more appreciation for Oahu and the Hawaiian people. Whatever you do, if you are coming to Oahu, use this app. Tour the Island with Eddie...it will deepen your experience and make your vacation memorable.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I bought the Shaka Tour guide to Oahu just before leaving for Hawaii.\n\nI had already done research online and was pretty much ready to do things on the list I had compiled.\n\nOnce in Oahu I decided to follow the Shaka guide on the Circle Tour and South Tour. Both were outstanding and set the stage for the rest of our stay.\n\nI highly recommend the app and the info contained for a fantastic time in Oahu.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"In lieu of doing a formal island tour with a tour company, we chose to purchase the circle island tour app and drive our rental car. The app was fabulous, driving directions were on point, narrative on sights was excellent and very informative, Hawaiian music was fun! We loved being able to stop at the sights we wanted to stop at and how the app pauses until you get back in the car and the app starts right back up where it left off. Loved the app, well worth the $6.99 investment!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"When we were in Hawaii we were going to pay for an island tour before we ventured out on our own, but then we met this couple who told us to save our $300 and download this app for $6. It was money well spent. It\u2019s a tour guide that gives turn by turn directions, typical touristy stops, off the beaten path stops, plays music, tells you where all the amazing food it, and gives a lot of history all at the same time. I like the independence of it and the super low cost. \ud83d\ude0a","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This tour is perfect for a chill and educational day in Hawaii. You can pick and choose when and where you want to stop and how long you want to stay in certain places. My husband and I are expecting and I\u2019m about 7 months pregnant so it was really really nice to be able to go at our on pace and not have to worry about keeping up with anyone else. We also really enjoyed the voice of the \u201ctour guide\u201d he was funny and very clearly spoken. The directions that he gave were very easy to follow. We had an amazing day because of this tour and we both learned a lot. \u2764\ufe0f","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"After debating on spending a hundred books or so for a tour of the island, someone recommended Shaka. Rented a car the next day and off we went. Simply...amazing.

I would recommend it to everyone who is willing to take a few hours to tour Oahu","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"The Concierge at our Hotel suggested the App so we decided to rent a Convertible Jeep and drive around the North Shore where the Waikiki Trolley has not taken us. All I can say is WOW!!! What an Amazing App. It literally felt like we had our own personal tour guide in the car. Not only did my kids think the guide was \u201cFunny\u201d but super informative, pre-warned us of what the next stop would be, where to turn to park, where the best restaurants and Bathroom stops would be, just Wonderful! We left with some breakfast in our stomachs at about 9 am, and we\u2019re headed back to Waikiki by 6:30pm. Love this App, would love to have it in Other locations around the World!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This app is so worth the small amount of money!  My hubby and I used it to circle Oahu while listening to all the cultural information, songs, and directions.  We felt as tho we where taking part in a guided tour!  And the best part is, since we couldn\u2019t stop at every location, it can be played again when convenient and as needed. Would definitely recommend!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"My wife and I had been on the Island for three days and did the first South Island twice in a row. The beaches, the scenery, the back stories into the History of Hawaii were all worth the cost of the app.\nI\u2019ve recommended this app to all of my friends and family already and can\u2019t wait to take the full day tour around the full Island. \nThis is a must have for anyone visiting Hawaii.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Love-it!\n\nWhat a fantastic app.  It is the best \u201ctour\u201d we have ever taken.  The app was precise and exact where we were at.

What was more enjoyable was we were moving at our pace.\n\nWe will take the other \u201ctour\u201d while here at Honolulu.\n\nWell done sir. Well done.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Our first time in Hawaii and this app helped us have a wonderful day checking out so many gorgeous places.  It was great listening to the music, stories and tips from the narrator guide.  We had an amazing day!!! The only reason it\u2019s not 5 stars is because we wanted more Hawaiian music during the ride!!!! Saved us tons of money on a physical tour guide and we did things on our own time.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"This was so much fun for me and the family!!

I absolutely loved it so much I decided to purchase the tour for Oahu! I have already been on the island for two months and the shake guide managed to bring me to places I have yet seen or heard of!

{"body":"I did both of the Oahu driving tours this month, and my life is better now. In between encounters with everything I was \"supposed\" to see on an Oahu trip, Shaka Guide revealed a ton of island features that are way off the basic beat. I recommend you eat everything he tells you to and consider bringing your own scuba gear.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"When I came to Hawaii, I had no idea what I wanted to do or what to see. I downloaded the app, started at 9am like recommended, and it was the best time ever! The narrator is fun to listen to, the stories are interesting, and doing it as a single person (39yrs old) was just as much fun. I can\u2019t wait to bring my son to Hawaii and do both tours with him because he\u2019ll love it too! I got both tours for Oahu and it\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve done while here!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"We did the Circle Island Tour and the South Shore Tour and they were great. We feel like we learned about things and saw things we wouldn\u2019t have otherwise done. Thanks to this app and the guide we went to Lanikai beach, which was my favorite part of the trip. It was so cool to have basically a personal guide :)","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"If you have a rental car, save some money and just use the app. You learn so much about the history of the island while you travel at your own pace. The narration was very informative. I thought I knew everything as we\u2019ve traveled to the islands multiple times. We took the tour and added stops like Pearl Harbor and Turtle Bay resort. The app just picks back up were you left off. It\u2019s so good and well worth the savings you get. Not just the monetary savings either. You aren\u2019t waiting at a rest stop while the entire tour bus lags behind.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I rented a car in Oahu and spent two days going on the tours in this app. I had an amazing time visiting places I would have otherwise missed. Perfect way to view the island and the directions are so easy to follow.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I purchased both the North Shore and the Circle Island tours in Oahu and 2 of the Hana Tours and the Haleakala tour in Maui. In would have given them 5 stars just on customer service, I had some questions and send them an email before we came to Hawaii and I was impressed by how Andrew replied to all my emails and how helpful he was. So 5 stars before I even used the app. Now that I actually did the tours I would give them 10 stars if it was available. This was our second time in Hawaii last time we used Gipsy Guide, it was ok but Shaka blew them out of the water. \u201cEddie\u201d as we call it took us to places that you don't read about on blogs or find in Pinterest, there were a couple of places we went to that we were the only tourists, in some we were the only ones there. There was a lookout point at Haleakala (this is our second time there) that Eddie told us to stop at, again we were the only car in the parking lot, and this was the best look out in history, the view were breathtaking, and the pictures.. WOW,  It was awesome! We keep saying, Hey, Eddie would go LOL. \nThank you Shaka Guide \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffb","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Purchased the app and downloaded from Kailua Beach. We wanted to take the route along the beach since we came through the mountain. But the guide app does not work going backwards...\n\nI wish the guide app gave you an option to go either direction of the tour. Also the app only works keeping the phone vertically and the map does not convert horizontally.\n\nIf the app could provide options of doing the tour either directions and convert the map horizontally...it would be a FIVE STAR.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

We were on the road by 8 AM.\n\nThis tour is fabulous!!!  We enjoyed it so much as did our 17 yr old daughter. It was nice to go at our own pace and stay as long or short as we wanted to at each location. We really enjoyed the narration and the music. Really kept our interest. We liked how it knew exactly where we were offline, too. Very cool!!  We liked this one so much that we\u2019re going to do the South Shore Tour tomorrow.\n\nThanks for sharing your love of the Oahu Island. We can\u2019t wait to visit again.

{"body":"In all my years owning an iPhone and buying apps, I\u2019ve never left feedback, but I just had to for you guys.  This app is incredible!   I\u2019ve toured a lot with groups, and had many great tours, and this had every bit as good information for those other tours with high $$ guides, but on the cheap!  As if that wasn\u2019t good enough, being in my own car with my wife, we could stop and go as desired. Your presentation was stellar!  Thank you so much for creating this incredible piece of app-ware!   Today we did the full island tour.  We\u2019re doing the South Island tour in the morning.   AWESOME!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We had a great tour!  Easy step by step directions and interesting commentary.  Would totally recommend this app.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was our first time in Oahu and this app was the perfect way to see the highlights of the island! We downloaded this app after using the same app for Road to Hana in Maui. Every stopping point was spot on amazing and we never would have found such amazing beaches, views  and authentic food without this app. I highly recommend this app to anyone visiting Oahu. The directions are very easy to follow and the tour includes a lot of useful history about the island. I can\u2019t wait to do the south shore tour on our next visit.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I would give this app 10 stars if I could! It provides an absolutely PERFECT way for me see Oahu; the app provided a lot of guidance, but its setup also allowed for a lot of freedom. I could use as much or as little guidance as I wanted depending on my interest level of each point of attraction. Thank you very much, Shaka, for allowing me to see so much of Oahu for such great value! I feel like I saw and learned just as much if not more than my friends who went on expensive guided tours. I also had a lot more flexibility than they did. THANK YOU! Highly recommend! I can\u2019t wait to use the app on the other islands!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is amazing! I took the circle tour of the island and experienced things I wouldn\u2019t have without it all while learning a lot along the way. So much fun and highly recommend.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My wife and I used the Shaka app to guide us on a tour of Oahu today and found it easy to follow and fun. Shaka guides us to lots of gems we would have never seen otherwise.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"First time in Hawaii. Loved the south shore tour, hopefully we will be able to do the circle island one soon. The narrator was easy to listen to and the local info great!! Best of all it was on your own time table.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Initially confusing. Because we had to start the map and the hit the recenter arrow in order for the app to start talking from the location we were currently at. \nAfter that the tips and navigation were spot on. It\u2019s best to have one person following the map\/ app and the driver listens to the talking. It got us to all the locations we wanted to go and got us back home.\nLoved the fact that we could take in the sites at our own pace. \nThe music and stories were nice accompaniments. \nIt would be nice if it worked with our phone GPS since if we took the wrong route the app stopped talking as it will only work in a counter clockwise direction.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"This was the best money spent on an app! Just buy it seriously if you spent the money to rent a car in Hawaii then you can afford the $5 for each tour. It worked flawlessly directions were spot on and when synced to your vehicles audio it\u2019s like your own private tour! My wife and I loved it and we will be buying the tours for the other islands as well.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Two separate friends suggested that we get this app. So much better than a tour. History. Sites. Food suggestions. Can\u2019t wait to use the Maui tour!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Came upon this app as I was preparing for our Hawaii vacation.  Spent $6 total as compared to 4 people x $75 for a tour group.  It was amazing!  So informative and the GPS timing with the voice was spot on.  Amazing App!  I hope these are available every place I go!  Enabled us to take our time and fantastic information to learn as well as great ideas to stop and eat !   Thank you Shaka - really great!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Took the Oahu Circle Island Tour today using the Shaka app.  It could not have been easier!  Started in Waikiki around 9:25am and ended back at the rental car place around 5:30.  8 solid hours of exploring the island using the guide.  This app is worth 10 times what I paid.  Will highly recommend this to anyone considering going it without paying rigid tour operator prices.\n\nThank you!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We bought both tours and totally worth every penny!!  We split the south tour in 2 days. Spent about 9 hours on the trip around the island. Loved every minute of it!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My wife and I absolutely loved this self guided tour. We used this app on all the islands we visited and every single time was amazing. Would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a fun day of sight seeing and hiking.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was an excellent recommendation. We traveled with little kids so being able to go on a tour at our own pace, eat when we want to, stop when we want to, turn around if we have to was perfect. The turn and turn directions were on point and being able to learn about the history of landmarks while driving was a highlight worth the money! We saw everything we wanted to and more with time to spare. Well worth it!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"What a great way to see Oahu. We rented a car for the day, drove around at our own leisure, and returned the car late evening. It costs $40-50 to park a car overnight, so this made sense. The guide gave great driving directions and always in plenty of time to make turns, etc. I highly recommend it.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We were absolutely amazed at the technology that allowed us to explore the island on our own.  We saw so many incredible sights that we would have never known about. We recommend this to anyone who asks what to do on the island. Thanks so much for the memories we will take home with us from your guide.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is my second visit to the Island of O\u2019ahu and both times my fellow travelers and I have immensely enjoyed not just the tips on great beaches and food, but the tidbits of history along the way!  I can\u2019t wait till use Shaka Maui!  MAHALO!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Lots of attention to detail. Love the spoken directions and recommendations. It seemed like the tour guide was in the car listening to our conversations and responding with appropriate suggestions. I would give it 5 stars if the tour could be run it either direction as the counter clockwise format did not always accommodate my schedule.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"This was the best day!!! We were skeptical but will was absolutely the best choice for us!!! Amazing how it knows exactly where you are and guides you. Perfectly & timely \nJust do it!!! Well worth it.... especially after watching the miserable people on the big tour buses. I hope you guys come up with more tour options.... maybe shorter focused ones","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was worth every penny. It was perfect explained everything and we were so happy to have found this. Would recommend to everyone.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My family was so glad to have had this app for our vacation! We toured nearly the whole island (O\u2019ahu)  with both audio tours and learned so much! It was accurate for navigating, giving plenty of notice in advance to know when to pull in to sites.  Loved that it didn\u2019t use data. Perfect combination of food\/sightseeing\/historic stops and information.  10\/10 would recommend if you\u2019re looking to adventure efficiently!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this app tour!!! We saw (& did) SO MUCH!!! I am Absolutely POSITIVE we would have missed so much of all that Oahu has to offer without this WONDERFUL app!!! Thank You!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Loved using this to tell us what we were looking at. Did the tour over 3 days. So simple to use and so much fun - the narrator is a bit corny but that only added to it all.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Probably the best thing I\u2019ve seen in the last few years.\nVery few negatives things to say about it.\nGet it immediately!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We had just one day on Oahu during our March cruise. I had seen a recommendation for the Shaka tour on Cruise Critic and purchased it. That was our BEST day of the trip! We loved the island so much that we are returning in 2018 and will let Shaka be our guide on leisurely drives around the island. The App worked perfectly and we loved it - I'm sure we saw things that other tourists miss.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We LOVED this app. Five of us visiting the island for the first time and we had several options for planning our visit, including paying $85 per person for a bus tour of Oahu. Found this app while browsing online and it is the best thing we have dine the whole trip! We loved the information and stories, music, jokes and help with the local language. The directions for the tour are perfectly timed and easy to follow without getting lost. Good inside information on beaches, parking, restaurants and clean restrooms. We did both the north and south circle tours and saw so much more than we could have ever found on our own and for a fraction of the cost of a bus tour. I highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to see all the highlights including the things you don\u2019t learn about on travel websites! Thank you Shaka guide!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I was a little septic about spending $4.99 on an app, but let me tell you it\u2019s worth it. If you like self guided exploration do your self a favor and get this app, it will make exploration 100 times better!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Really enjoyed using this app. The app glitched a little at the beginning but hard starting the phone solves the problem and worked great. I loved that this app will start at Ko Olina which was very helpful.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"We bought this app on a whim after a short google search told us about it... and what an amazing thing to have stumbled upon!! We did both the circle tour and the south shore tour and LOVED both of them!! The app was so spot on with directions and recommendations! The stories and music that accompanied really helped us learn about the Hawaiian culture and folklore without having had much time to research our trip! We are so happy with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone!!! Saved us a lot of time, money and maximized our time here in Oahu!! Looking forward to the Maui tour next!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Excellent program. Felt like the guide was in our car.  Allowed us time to do everything at our own pace.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We competed the South Shore Tour of Oahu today. The App is so easy to use, it's easy to follow, informative and just a great way to see parts of the Island you would otherwise never know existed. My only regret is that we didn't do the tour earlier in our vacation because if we had, we would have had time to revisit and spend more time at some of our favorite spots.  The Tour took us about 5 hours and we definitely could have started earlier in the day and taken the whole day to make the trip. We are looking forward to taking the Circle Island Tour tomorrow!  Absolutely Awesome!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"After over 10 trips to the Islands, the app made it feel like we had our own personal guide with all the details. I thought i knew about Oahua, but now i really do. Fun, entertaining and easy map directions. I highly recommend.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Perfect instructions, great tips, and educational stories!  We really appreciated having this app for our first trip to Hawaii. Perfect!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was amazing!!   I bought the Oahu Island Circle tour on a whim after renting a car in Waikiki.  The directions were clear and easy to follow and the stories were informative and delightful.  The narrator had a wonderful personality.  What I would say, however ... is that I wasn\u2019t really clear on how to \u201cstart\u201d the app to get t the narrating.  We basically drove until we actually got on the route (H1 West) and then all of a sudden the guided part of the app started right up!!  It was seamless once you get n the tour path ... but until then ... it seemed like we were kind of on our own.  We got the app literally as we were walking down to the rental ... so really didn\u2019t put too much thought into reading directions.\n\nOnce we \u201cgot it\u201d - we LOVED the thoughtful, easy directions, and will use Shaka guides in the future when touring Hawaii.  BTW - this saved us hundreds as compared to getting a private tour!!!  We rented a convertible Mustang and had a blast with this app.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I am so glad we found this app! We were looking for something to do for my in laws anniversary and stumbled upon Shaka guide. We had the best day, it took us to places we haven\u2019t visited and told us stories we have never heard.  We love this app and will recommend it to anyone!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I hadn\u2019t been back to Hawaii in 20 years but still thought I knew my way around enough to give my family a tour but after doing some research and finding this app, the tour was that much better! Great app for a great price! Thanks guys!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"So we did both tours. We started with the shorter south tour then the longer circle tour on another day. \n\nBringing a charger is a must because this app will eat up a battery. I also strongly suggest brining a portable phone holder so the driver can see the map and talk bubbles. \n\nMost cars have Bluetooth or bring a portable Bluetooth speaker for all occupants listening pleasure.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We had a blast. Took us about 8 hours. Stopped at most of the sites on the app. Loved Leonard\u2019s, Kuloa Ranch, Sunset Beach, Fruit Stand, Polynesian Center, Dole Plantation - did the maze & train tour, ....the app did a great job of explaining the history & lead us in the right direction to all the sites. Good Job!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great app!  This app has taken us to more places then one of the famous tour bus in Waikiki.  Love it and was very easy to follow.  Definitely will recommend this to all our friends.  Best $5 ever spent!!! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Download this app and do it before anything else! You'll receive an exceptional overview of all you can see and do and come back later for more time. I wish we knew about it before, when we were on the big island too. Highly recommended.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is the 2nd app\/guide I've bought from Shaka Guide. Don't hesitate. Just buy it. The navigation is just as great as Google Maps but with historical and funny narrations as you drive.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Being my first to the island, this app came in very handy. Precise directions and we could do it all on our own. We took our time at the sights and didn\u2019t have to worry about the tour bus leaving or be forced to go to a tourist shop or tourist sight we didn\u2019t feel like going to. It was like a buffet where you could sample whatever you liked and in whatever time frame you desired. I wish all cities in the world had apps like this.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Just like a high priced tour guide. Everything fun and accurate, we recommended it to fellow travelers that asked what we were using. excellent!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We bought both the Gypsy Guide and Shaka Guide.  Shaka had a delayed start up, required a reload, and Apple app password to re activate.  Gypsy started immediately with no delays.  Shaka has music, Gypsy does not.  The Gypsy felt like you had a real tour guide with you, was informative and very detailed directions.  Shaka provided similar narrative, but we just never warmed up to the Narrator.  It is a matter of style.  In our case, it was a matter of function,  Shaka did not function well on my iPhone.  Gypsy functioned well.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"These apps are what they say they are, it is just like having a tour guide with you in the car with knowledge of the area and a sense of humor. We hated to see the tour come to an end!  Best app yet in my opinion!!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My family and I absolutely love this app. We did both the South tour and the Circle island. The App pointed out all the best spots do do everything we wanted on the island. Absolutely outstanding.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We just used the Shaka Guide for a circle tour of Oahu and it was better than using any guide book! We enjoyed all aspects of the app tour. It gives clear directions, plays great tunes and is full of excellent information about the sites along the way. It took all the pressure of looking at a book or local maps off of us so we could just enjoy the stops along the way. Thanks Shaka Guide for helping us have a wonderful day driving around Oahu!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Let me start by saying I don\u2019t write app reviews, but this app was so good I felt compelled to let other know. If you want to tour the island yourself, go for it. In my opinion this app is better than any guided tour that you could take on a bus. The information they provide his professional and extremely accurate. It would take someone a lot of time to research all the stuff this app provides. My only other suggestion to anyone wanting to tour the island themselves is to rent a convertible. There are many things on the tour that would be difficult to see if you had a roof","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"can not recommend this app enough. It is literally like having a local in the car with you the whole time! No need to use your gps, the guide gives clear and timely directions that make driving around the island not only more enjoyable, but safer! Highly recommend this to anyone who wants to explore on their own.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I am so glad got this app. It is great and I would recommend anyone who visits Hawaii. Easy to use and great tour guide and pretty funny and informative! Love love this app. We had great tour!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is amazing! It shows great places while giving interesting informations, funny facts and even playing local music sometimes \nAll the given advices were great ! It really was the best guide for a dollars ! We had a wonderful day thanks to this app :)","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Purchased Road to Hana app and it was great. You never feel lost with this app. It follows you along at your pace. Just did the circle tour on Oahu and we again were extremely happy with it. So glad we came across these apps beforehand. Made our trips so much more enjoyable and so much less stressful worrying about making a wrong turn. You can't get lost with this app. Worth its weight in gold. \ud83d\ude00","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We did not know where to go in Oahu, but everyone kept saying we had to go see the North Shore. We rented a car, downloaded this app, and set off.  One thing I really loved was the guide told you where to turn, with plenty of advance notice, so it was safe feeling.  We learned plenty of new things on the drive and went to places we would have never found had we not had the app. Whoever designed this app, made our trip go from good to great. It was definitely worth the money. If we ever go to Oahu again or one of the other islands, we will use this again. Nothing bad to say.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"So after a Kauai trip gone wrong and a desperate google search we found this app. (See Kauai review). So good we bought this one too. While not as good as Kauai it was well worth it. The humor was a little more eye rollingly bad on this one and the spots not nearly so out of the way. Probably could have not got this one but great for first timers. Also note--at least double the time suggested. Even if you barely stop for 5 min pictures not the 2 hr hikes it's still gonna take you 4 hours to do these. We broke the north shore one into 2 days. But I'll definitely get the Maui one on the next trip!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Only reason why four instead of five the time to do the tours is way off if you want to do all the things recomend starting early and maibe skipping some of the stops","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I can't believe how good this app is. Honestly is one of the best apps ever for me, not just on tours but on any app domain. \nMe and my daughter had a fantastic time both in Oahu and Maui. The app not just guided us across the touristic locations but took us to hidden gems known mostly by locals. \nValue for money? Infinite. \nIf you ever go to Hawaii buy Shaka for any island you visit.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Best App Store purchase value ever! A friend told us about this guide before our visit to Oahu and we purchase the circle island tour. It was much better than expected. We had an awesome time following the guide and will be certain to buy their other guides for future visits.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"After successfully completing the Road to Hana tour on Maui, mostly thanks to the great guidance of the Shaka guide app, my husband and I decided to once again rely on the Shaka app when renting a car on Oahu. We followed the Island circle tour and we were again not disappointed. , Loved the clear directions, point of interest notifications, interesting stories, and tips about food and public facilities. We stopped at the food trucks for lunch as recommended and had the best shrimp dish ever!!! Too bad we were flying home the following day 'cause I would have loved to have driven the South Shore Tour too! Maybe next time. Anyway, this app is a must have if you are planning on exploring Oahu on your own and the best 5 bucks spent! (besides maybe the Dole's Twist with topping at the Dole pineapple plantation)","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was our second year back to Oahu, our first trip we paid for a few \"Tours\". We really wanted to get away from the standard tourist stuff and this app did just that! Save tons of money and give yourself a half day to fully enjoy the stops. Longer if you bring the kiddos. What a great app find!!! I highly recommend this to anyone who likes to take things at your own pace!!!! I would have done 5 stars but we couldn't get the voice guidance to replay once we past a listening point. Only missed a few with the learning curve.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"My family and I enjoyed the tours and appreciated all of the history given at each site. GPS was spot on and the parking tips were invaluable! Thank you for this awesome app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Both the tours I took on Oahu were so beyond amazing! I'm a solo traveler and I wish they had these for multiple places! Awesome job guys!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Husband and I used this app to tour the island. We loved it! The guidance was accurate and narration made it very enjoyable. It took us over 6 hours to do the Circle the Island tour and that was with only a few stops. I don't see it being possible to do in 3 hours unless you don't stop. Many paces close around 5-6pm so plan to leave early so you don't miss out. \n\nWe will be looking for this guide to tour other islands. Highly recommend!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I don't usually rate apps, but this one was great! I was traveling by myself, and this made touring Oahu much easier and enjoyable! I was highly impressed!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Just listen to Shaka (even if it is a hand signal), he'll tell you where to go!! We loved the large circle tour and we'll likely get the south tour tomorrow before we go to the airport. \n\nWe're on the main island for a wedding that was on the north shore in Laie. Since we wanted to hit the dole plantation on the way back, it made sense to buy the tour for $5. While at the wedding, it was pretty fun sharing all the cool information that Shaka had told us up to that point. We met back with our group at Waimea and told them that we had visited the ceremonial grounds where human sacrafices had taken place, others finally asked, \"where are you getting this information?\" (Shaka!).\n \nI have the same complaint of the odd no sound spots, but the views certainly compensate for the silence. Also, it may have just been the USB connectivity in the car, but the last 1 or 2 seconds of the directions seemed to cut out, which at some points, included critical driving directions. Fortunately, we didn't get lost, and the map is easy to follow in case you somehow miss a turn.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We were headed to a luau and met some newlyweds. They gave us advice to try Shaka Oahu. We did and throughly enjoyed the recommendations!  It worked off of the phone's GPS.  If I could have figured out how to make it work through the rental's audio system I believe we would have enjoyed it more. It was awesome!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is a great app when you visit this island!   Much culture, history, music, and directions -- all without using data.  Turn your navigation system off and use Shaka instead!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We wanted to tour the island, but didn't want to go in a tour group. This was amazing! It had all the best of a tour, without the pressure to go at their speed.  With both tours, circle tour and south tour, you do the whole island.  If we wanted to stop, we put the tour on pause and stopped. Wanted to skip something to do another day, just drove past and the tour picked up again. It was perfect for us!  We loved the music too. It was the perfect addition to our trip! I highly recommend!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I had difficulty getting the guide to work on my iPhone and called the customer support number.  A live human picked up (can't recall his name) and spent 20 minutes with me troubleshooting the problem.  He got it installed and it worked perfectly throughout the tour.  My family enjoyed their guided tour and we will purchase again when we get to Maui.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was the absolute perfect way for us to explore the island. Directions are clear, information is excellent, and the pacing was perfect for us. We were able to do all we wanted, and skip what didn't interest us. Five stars!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I stumbled across this app when I realized how expensive excursion tours were. Knowing we had a vehicle, this was a no-brainer. With great directions, stories and history, local music and notes of food and stops, I cannot recommend this app enough--especially since it can be downloaded and doesn't burn data. If only more tours were available around the world, this would be my go-to every time! Mahalo!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My husband and I downloaded this guide over breakfast as we discussed taking an Oahu island tour. I had been on an island tour with one of the small tour companies in Nov 2015. It was great, but I felt very rushed. My husband and I always rent a car when we're on the island, and decide to venture in our own. I started mapping a route but needed a tour guide. That's when I thought to search for an app that does it all. This one really delivers! So rent a car, skip the pricey, rushed island tours and venture in your own! The guide is extremely accurate and led us to MANY unbelievable sites! My favorite was the jungle waterfall on Mt. Pali! \n\nGet this app, you won't be disappointed!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We are so happy that we brought this app to spend our time in Hawaii. It saved several hours of research to find out sightseeing places. App neatly arranged all the location so that there is no back and forth from one place to other. We maximized number of places and it helped to understand history behind each location. Our kinds learned a lot about Hawaiian history legends, music, customs, etc. In short this app made our trip one of best experience.\n \nThis app may seem expensive but it's really worth for every penny.\n \nWe experienced couple of technical glitches and customer support is awesome.\n\nWe love narrator. Keep producing quality app like this for other key locations in US.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Considering what you'd pay for a grayline tour per person, this app is worth a he'll of a lot more than $5. Easy to use, take your time, and see just as much if not more than a real person guided company tour. We'll worth it, DO IT!!!  Mohalo Shaka!!! \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udf08","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Extremely impressed. Can hardly imagine a better execution of the idea.\n\nOnly bummers are 1) you must drive counterclockwise around the island and 2) there isn't any local style music playing in between waypoints\/stories.\n\nBut, no matter. This made an ordinarily beautiful drive into an extraordinarily entertaining and even educational one. Wish I had this for everywhere.\n\nGreat job and mahalo!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Well worth the price and the download!  Very informative as you drive and it takes you off the beaten path a bit to some unknown stops.  Gives GREAT history of Hawaii and Oahu!   One thing to suggest...we stopped at shrimp trucks but app did not mention they are cash only...didn't have enough cash to eat and had to drive back a few miles to find an ATM to get some cash to eat.  Other than that...I suggest you you download and take the drive!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I toured 3 islands; Maui, Kauai and Oahu and this app was the best thing I could have asked for.  The tour is informative, fun and very detailed.  We saw things we would have never known about!  It works perfectly, tells you exactly where to go, where to stop, eat and even where there are public restrooms.  DON'T HESITATE, BUY IT!  Kudos to the app makers for creating such a wonderful app!  Worth every penny!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Mahalo for a superb app! I have vacationed on Oahu many times, yet I learned new things about this wonderful island thanks to your tour. Well done!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was spot on. So much information and great places to stop at your own pace. Sometimes there was too much information and if you drive over the speed limit the GPS navigation points may overlap each other. Great way to see the island.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Very well put together, informative, spot on, and entertaining! Download the tour, turn it on and away you go! Fun & easy!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app delivered far more than I was expecting.   We saw wonderful places we would have never seen or even heard about.  We followed the recommendation on food trucks and we were really glad we did.  The app worked flawlessly. We loved the history narration and the stories.  The driving directions were spot on. The music was great.  Thanks!!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"With this guide I have no worries ... made our trip so wonderful, even recommended to friends we met along the way of how easy it is to Tour the Island without spending a lot. One thought thou, wish the app could go on either direction and still be precise.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We enjoyed the narrated tour to the North Shore of Oahu very much. I had done some research on things to see but would have missed  a lot of great stuff if I had relied on my various pins and guidebook notes. Also I could enjoy the ride while listening to the tidbits and directions instead of always having to be setting up my phone with an address for the next stop. This tour took care of everything!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We purchased both tours and had a great time. Definitely give more time than the app recommends as there are several places you will want to stop and take your time at along the way. I would also suggest you look through the attractions on each tour before you start the tour. We saw a number of packed tour buses along the way, but this app allowed us to do a tour on our own and take as much time as we wanted, for far less money. \n\nIf you are visiting Oahu, I highly recommend you purchase these tours. The developers and tour guides that put this together did a fantastic job. I will definitely purchase their other tours\/apps in the future.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We absolutely LOVED this app! The tour is timely, accurate, fun, educational and easy to use! It's the best and most affordable option to tour the island. We did Oahu and will def do all the other islands knowing that the app has tours for them too. Even if you factor in car rental cost, parking at your hotel (if you rent prior evening) etc. it's 100% recommended and cheaper than having to get stuck on some generic tour that dictates what, when and where you go. Great job Shaka developers please create for other cities too :)","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Used the guide while driving the outside perimeter of Oahu. We got a bit confused between the south circle tour and the northern tour. We started with the south and then changed to the other. We enjoyed the tours, very informative. Good job.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"AMAZING! Best money spent. Great way to see the island plus learning lots of history....wonderful. Highly recommend.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"No need to plan your day with notes and books and recommendations from friends! Shaka Guides are entertaining, thorough and  easy to use. The best $4.99 you can spend! We used Shaka on Kauai, Oahu, and tomorrow the Big Island.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Fun guide. We hesitated at first but in the end worth every penny. Took us around the island to places we would have missed.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I've been coming to Hawaii for years as a flight attendant but this was only the 3rd time I've been here on vacation. I purchased both tours for Oahu and my family and I couldn't have been happier. These were fantastic! We spent two fabulous days touring the island and we would never have been able to see so many sights without this app. I highly recommend \"Shaka Oahu\". It was so easy to follow and we loved how we could listen to it through the sound system in the car. Worth every penny!!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Shaka OAHU was a great guide. This was my 7th trip to Oahu in the last 12 months, but since my wife was coming along this time, we decided to grab the app to learn more about the island. The tour was great (very similar to what I did myself previously using the rental car map books), but the narration and GPS guidance was really worth the extra few dollars I spent on the app.\n\nHaven't been here many times, I knew most of the \"big ticket\" items to see, but the app took us to a couple \"off-the-path\" places that we really loved (like the waterfall off Pali in the Southern Island tour). \n\nThe only complain I had was that there are parts where there are \"blanks\" (no narration and no music). Would be great if they had a simple \"Hawaiian music\" loop that plays when you are between tour spots for a little driving music. Since it uses my iPhone while driving, I couldn't play my own music, either.  Otherwise, a great app and I hope they make a few more, maybe some walking tours through Waikiki or Honolulu?","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Very informative and helpful tour guide-y way to see the sights of the island at your own pace. Skip what doesn't speak to you and linger on the good stuff. Little hints like free macadamia nuts is highly valuable information! A little confusing to get started, but after that hiccup, a fun way to self tour and skip the tour bus.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Used it today to go around Oahu started at 8AM and with a good number stops wrapped up about 4:30PM it was amazing to hear the history and the app was spot on for directions. Worth every penny going to get the south shore one as well! You will not regret this way of touring the island!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Discovered this by accident about a month before our trip to Oahu and didn't really know how it would work out.  What we did know is we didn't want to spend BIG bucks to tour the island in a bus on a timetable! We made the $10 plunge, along with the minimal tour costs for each tour (Circle and South End)...AND WE LOVED IT...IT WAS AWESOME!  It's easy to use, directional, informative, funny, and just out right entertaining!  AND, we could do it all within our own timetable...multiples times, if we wanted!  When I had a slight \"user error\" issue, I called them and got a real person who was awesome and walked me through it in no time. During our entire trip we were telling others that they should get this if they really wanted to get to know the island, it's history, culture and some of the hidden adventures.  If we go back to other islands, this will be the first thing we'll use!  Highly, highly recommended!  Great job you guys!  Thanks!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This App made our vacation so seamless. Today I didn't have to plan anything but pack our bags for the beach.  We did the tour at our own pace and it was perfect! This app was worth way more than I paid for it. If your rental doesn't have Bluetooth then you need to bring a aux cord.  Playing the audio through the stereo is worth it.  Buy this app you will be glad you did. \ud83e\udd19","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I usually don't review many apps, but this is one app that I think deserves one... I have to say that this was the best purchase I could have made to help get us around Oahu! The directions, music, great points of interest, and fun facts were all top notch. We did the Circle Island Tour and had a great time visiting all of the locations. I can't wait to take the other tours the next time we come back to Hawaii!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Well-implemented and very-usable navigator and guide app. Directions are very accurate. The narrative is sometimes corny and simplistic, but usually informative and easy on the ears. Thoroughly enjoyed a nearly-full day trip around Oahu. Don't start later than mid-morning. Lunch at the shrimp shacks and have an afternoon snack at Yamamoto's Shave Ice. Don't miss the Byodo Inn Temple. If you want to do the Polynesian Cultural Center or Waimea Valley or Dole Pineapple Plantation, probably need to do a separate trip. There's a full day without any of those.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This tour kept us busy for two days since we had to stop at every point of interest.  My husband & I absolutely loved it!  And the fact that the app took care of all the directions made driving easy.  Highly recommended!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We live on Oahu and use this app every time we have visitors. Very informative and a great way to tour the island on your own and learn the history of the island chain.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Excellent tour from your phone for a fraction of the cost to get a guide. Loved it and used it on kona and Oahu.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was amazing, far exceeding my expectation. We rented a car in Oahu and did the circle tour around the island, and it worked as good as or better than a live tour guide.  With downloaded maps and gps, you don't need to use any data and the app talks to you the whole time, or otherwise plays Hawaiian music. Love it!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We loved it!  Like having our personal tour guide in the car.  Cool out of the way stops and trivia.  We laughed at the jokes, too.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Great Shaka app to enhance your driving tours on Oahu. Purchased both tours but we actually combined the tours into one day's drive. Learned so much more than if we would have driven the island without the narration. The GPS directions were great and kept us from having to rely on maps.  Make sure you have a car charger with you as some cars don't work correctly through the audio system!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is great. We used it to take a drive on Oahu in December 2016 (North Shore Tour). \n\nWorks flawlessly with GPS. Saw several places we wouldn't have known about or seen without the guide's suggestion. \n\nMy only \"complaint\" is there was too much good stuff to stop and see that we ran out of daylight. I'd say plan a FULL day so you can see all the suggested stops and savor the beauty of Oahu.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app has a plethora of information!  Hawaiian history, out-of-the-way places, even food options!\nAndrew helped us out by phone when we had a problem.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We just did this tour and it is amazing. The directions are extremely easy to follow. The price worth it!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"So glad I had this app! I got both the circle tour and east tour for Oahu and would say that it made our 2nd trip to the island so much better than our first time around! I totally wish I had it for our previous trips to other islands. We saw things and learned things that we never would have had we just looked online ourselves. My whole family including our 4 kids enjoyed listening to the music and stories.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was my first trip to Hawaii. I love seeing sites and hearing about the places I go. My wife does not like tours at all. I talked her into renting a car and trying it ourself using this app. She loved it! I did as well. We saw many well-known site as well as some off the path places that were incredible. Will definitely recommend this app to my friends who are coming to a Oahu!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Use this app if you are vacationing on Oahu, period!! We were so happy with every facet of the app. The music, the history, the fun facts as you drive, and most of all the locations it recommends are just things you won't find in an easy-to-navigate, compact guide anywhere else. We saw some of the most breathtaking views, were tipped off about good local food and roadside stores, and enjoyed hearing the stories the guide tells you in between. With a car charger, you do plenty enough driving to keep your phone charged, and the no data option is absolutely genius. I downloaded it ahead of time and had no problems whatsoever. We did the Circle Tour and edited it a bit to our needs. We then completed it over the course of 2 days because we went during the winter and lost sunlight fast. It could be done in 1 day if you start early in the AM and pay attention to the time, but we had no need to be rushed.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Turn off your data and let Shaka do the guiding. What a great app and awesome value. \n\nThe only thing to note for the Oahu circle tour and south shore circle tour is that you must do them counter clockwise. \n\nMake sure to checkout the highlights section as well. \n\nEasily the best $8-9 I spent on my trip!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I have lived in Hawaii 40 years and two years of it on Oahu.  I learned things I didn't know, drove down a couple offshoots I wouldn't have otherwise , and loved loved loved driving with the direction, information, suggestions, music, stories, etc.  so much better and worthwhile been driving without it.  I had a couple questions and called two times to the number offered and each time was answered promptly by a real person who helped me with Aloha.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I broke my leg after being on the island only 24 hours.  After surgery this tour was really helpful because it allowed us to see the sites right from the car. Directions brought us to the best vantage points and we saw some spectacular scenery.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was worth it 110%! Having this play over the speakers of the Jeep while we drove through the island made this seem like a real adventure. The music, stories, and food stops, made the trip fantastic. Simply googling destinations is not the way to see the island. This takes you to places you would never find on your own, and too many to remember if someone told you. We did both tours on the app for Oahu and it took us three days to compete! I had a question about the app, tapped the phone number available an someone answered within 3 rings and answered my question! I wish they had these tours for Illinois!! Amazing job! And the price is worth every penny!!! Honestly made the vacation 100X better than we dreamed.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Do this! This is a great app, and we really enjoyed the Circle Island Tour. We got much more info about the points of interest that if we tried to figure out where to go on our own. We had some issues at the beginning (our fault) and Andrew in Customer Service called during the tour to check in and see how we were doing. THAT is excellent customer service.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I can't say enough good things about this app. It runs off GPS, which means no data or signal troubles. The turn-by-turn directions were spot-on. It gave us the chance to explore the island at our own pace, with our own personal guide. \n\nYeah, the narration is a little corny, but that was part of the fun. \n\nWe felt like we had truly explored every corner of the island. Would highly recommend to first-time visitors.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The app was full of great narration. Easy and clear directions, interesting places to see, and also some historical info for context. The narrator is really good, kind of an Hawaiian Casey Casem, if you know what I mean. I really enjoyed this and it made the drive and stops a lot more interesting and fun.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I was impressed with how clear the driving directions were, how appropriately the music was chosen, and how interesting and authentic the commentary was. We saw some top tourist places but also saw some hidden gems. We had trouble navigating from step 100 to 101 on South Shore tour but figured it out after 5 minutes, pulling over looking at the map.\nHighly recommended! I want to have something like this for traveling all over the world.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I wish apps like this were available for everywhere. The directions are great and the information is so interesting.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Very cool app!  Extremely helpful AND entertaining! We all got a kick out of some of the narrations along the way. Highly recommended. One improvement would simply be to highlight where you are when in the list mode.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is by far one of my favorite apps. It told us about places that we wouldn't have found on our own without having to pay $$$$ on some corny group tour. The app gives you turn by turn directions and allows you to pause the app when you want to get out to take pictures, snorkel, eat or any of the other great attractions mentioned in the app.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"It is corny. It is cheesy. It is great. It is so good we did each one a second time to make sure we hit everything. Cannot wait to use the Maui and Kauai versions next week.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My sister and I downloaded the island circle tour. It was one of our best days in Oahu. I love that they tell you all the cool local grindz to eat at. Make sure you bring cash. We also saw some amazing beaches, snorkeled, and visited many religious sites! I highly recommend this app","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was our second Shaka tour in Hawaii.  \nLike Maui:Haleakala it was THE BEST VALUE we got in Hawaii. It worked flawlessly and was informative and entertaining (if a tiny bit repetitive of other tours). \nIf you are thinking about booking a tour in Hawaii, skip it and get the relevant Shaka Tour. \nYou won't be disappointed.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Second trip to Oahu. First trip here we drove to the north shore and did not know about this app. This last time we used the app and did the circle island tour. I would never take another driving tour without an app like this. If you are on the fence....buy it. You will not be disappointed.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This guide paid for itself 100 times over. We could have spent hundreds on a guide or a tour bus, instead we spent what it would cost for a coffee and had a day to remember!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Entertaining and educational. My wife, young sons and I enjoyed the tour. The music and narrative are great. Couldn't help but smile as we drove around listening. Really a bargain for what you get!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We got the Oahu circle tour. It does what it promises - you drive it tells you what is around and what is worth seeing. If you are not the guy that reads you guide book as your wife drives than this app is for you. It has the right balance of information, fun, and nice bites to stop for. It also made us make a number of turns that leads you to interesting places you would otherwise miss.\nI have to confess that I am not very tech savvy so it took me some time to make it work. If you do not see the app once you buy it go to menu and push retire my purchases - it will appears as bought.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Shaka tours helped guide me through well known sites as well as those off the beaten path. Love the history narrations!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"We purchased both the half island and full island Oahu tours and the app took us to all the great places and delivered great history on Hawaii. Will be purchasing Shaka tours for the other islands when I return to Hawaii. Great job on making the app!  It truly helped make my vacation perfect without having to spend too much time studying maps, or making sure I had a list of all the places I wanted to visit.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

As a vacationer it is important to research restaurants on the island and make choices based on ratings, price, menu, and location. This app doesn\u2019t provide this capability, thus I deleted it shortly after downloading it. Waste of $5.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app is a total rip-off. You can get more information from a two second search on the Internet.

None of the toll road exits (DNT, Bush, etc) even show up on this app. Those that do, have outdated pricing. They do show pricing for many of the primary all-lane scanners (Ex: Parker\/DNT, Bush\/Coit), but north of 121 = no pricing. Tex-press = no pricing. Sam Rayburn (121 Tollway) = no pricing. \n \nOn top of that, it costs $3. \n\nHard pass!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"My family of 5 adults wanted to make a quick 2 hour stop in Pompeii. We purchased skip the line tickets in October although the main entrance did not have many people. This app was reasonably priced. It works well offline, only off by a little, and I liked the photo references. The suggested path with key landmarks was nice. I give this app 4 stars vs 5 only because I wish there was both a short and long historical commentary\/description. I was the only one in our group who paid for this app. So, it was difficult to find the key aspects of the written history on a brief walk through ruins with 5 people and lots of tourists around. We just wanted the high level overview. It would be nice to have summaries of each location and a longer description as an option for those who really enjoy history.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}

Great app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I love this app. It is very intuitive. I can map out all of my vacations, see optional routes, include points of interests that don\u2019t need to be on the route itself. I can change all the icons on the map just for fun. It computes not just the time to go someplace but also the gas cost. I can add notes of my own.\n\nThe neat thing is that this app doesn't just sync on the cloud - I can send my maps to others. Or just save your completed map routes to Dropbox or cloud drive to download later.  Or I can upload my routes to Google Maps for step by step directions.\n\nI have tried other routing maps - and most require really weird subscriptions. This one does not. It is a straight forward app that lets you try it for free with all options except saving changes you make. The price for this app is well worth it for being able to save new routes - and not worry about future surprises.\n\nI corresponded with the app\u2019s creator about a relatively minor issue and now just a few days later he fixed it with an update.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"An old friend and I started a Holiday road trip tradition this past year that honestly changed our lives. A major factor in its success we realized was the seamless nature in which we were able to use technology to help guide us toward the things we wanted to see, yet leave the ability jump around based on how we felt at any given moment.  This app was a key factor in allowing us to check off the must sees, move around the stuff we realized we didn\u2019t have time for, and keep moving forward without any feeling of being stuck or wondering what to do next.  This app will be the third wheel in all of our road trips (for which we have 3 files already in the works) to come!  A very special thanks to the creators for making such a relevant platform for people who like to wing it with at least some idea of what to see along the way.  \nThis app still gives you the feeling of rolling out that paper  map and pointing at spots of interest,  then just does all of the hard annoying work of discovering the route.\nMy only suggestion would be to include a real time Navi section at which point we\u2019d never have to switch between this and waze,  and if possible nudge us to check the gas tank after that feeling of relief to finally see the light of dawn after pulling out of an 8 hour overnight winter rainstorm through the hills of West Virginia,  thank god for AAA.\nOh,  and make it compatible with the new IPad keyboard.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"If you are old like me and learned computers from ancient times and had to memorize keyboard combinations to make anything logical happen on the screen then you will likely be able to muddle your way through this app to find a frustrating line drawn across the map to more than one place.  But hopefully you are also bald like me because you will try to pull out your hair in frustration while doing so.\n\nFor example:  We want the map page to show miles.  App deleloper tells us to go to callouts, change settings, and presto he says we will see mileage.  But of course we don't.  You can only see the mileage to or from a touched poi.\n\nThe app developer has obviously never used Microsoft Streets and Trips (by far still the best mapping program ever made!) because if he had he would combine the functionality of the magnifying glass and the disappearing\/morphing plus button into one search bar that never leaves the top of the screen.\n\nMy father was the kind of guy who was always right and never listened to constructive feedback so I am an expert at cutting my losses and moving on.  It was worth $6 to me just to write this review.\n\nLots of reviewers have expressed frustration with the user interface of this app.  They are all correct.  It is needlessly complicated.  The app developer obviously has the coding skills to make working apps, but he needs to learn the business skills to listen to his customers and make the user interface as easy as Streets and Trips.  If a 5th grader can't sit down with an ipad and plan a route w\/o help, the app needs continuous improvement.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

I\u2019d be plotting points of where I\u2019d be going on the map and then it\u2019d just go blank. All I had to do was re load the trip, but it still is annoying. \n\nWhat earned the app 1 star less was that you can\u2019t edit the order of the plots easily. \n\nSay you\u2019re planning a road trip and want to make a slight adjustment in the middle. As far as I know you have to completely start over. There is no way to manually change the order of stops with out starting from scratch. \n\nAlso If you have at least 1 stop that requires a plane, it completely renders some features useless. I\u2019d like the option to account for flights in the app. \n\nWith these complaints I feel like this is a decent app with some flaws that make it a pain to use sometimes.

If I have to collect the coordinates of every stop on my trip for this app to work, then what's the point of having a search bar?","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"If you know exactly where you want to go and have exact names, addresses, or map locations, this app may work for you. But if you are taking a leisurely road trip and want to find interesting or useful locations along your route, best look elsewhere.\n\n1) There is a search feature in this app, but it doesn't use the current map view to effectively restrict the results. This means that you are presented a list of search results from all over the world when all you want is what's along the 50 mile stretch of road you are currently looking at, and only the top few will be local to your current map view. compared to doing the same search in other map apps, most of the expected results just aren't there. Instead, the list is padded with far-off stuff places\u2014some from the other side of the world, even.\n\nAs an example, I searched for \"museum\" in a large metropolitan area, one that I know has many museums. However, only the first six were even from that state. The rest of the search results were from other states and overseas. Those distant locations shouldn't be returned\u2014they aren't in the range of my map view. If someone is interested in museums anywhere, they can zoom out first. There needs to be more complete local results and less padding from elsewhere.\n\n2) Also, if and when you do find and select a possible destination from the search results, the app zooms into the general area of the location but places no pin or other mark on the map. You can, at best, touch and hold on the map to make your own pin and hope you didn't just set a destination in the middle of a deserted corn field.\n\n3) The requirement that the user has to open a menu and press a button in order for the map to re-draw the route is something that should be replaced with background route updates. If I just added a new route point, we can be sure I no longer want the old route. Just update it for me.\n\n4) Also, when a new route point is added, it defaults to the end of the trip. In order to move it you have to leave the map to go to  list of route points, switch to edit mode, drag the route point up the list, stop editing and return to the map. If building up a route with many points, this gets annoying fast. Oh, and don't forget to tell it to update the route too.\n\nA good interface should minimize the number of times the user has to take unnecessary action\u2014like clicking buttons, opening menus, or dragging things around. Not eliminate, just minimize. This app needs to take that design philosophy to heart.\n\nAnd fix the search-\u2014I don't want to drive past the world's largest ball of twine without knowing about it. :)\n\nResponse to Developer: My goal is to help improve your app, if I can. :) I found the feature you referred to in your initial response. It doesn't, however address the need for adding new stops along a route. It only locates places close to an already chosen waypoint, and it doesn't allow for them to be added as new waypoints, as far as I could tell. Am I missing something else that might be hidden in a menu?","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

In general the app works well and is helpful for planning road trips.  However a problem surfaced when I tried to add some route pins to an existing plan.  According to the company's web site you're supposed to be able to rearrange route pins. This of course is necessary if you want to add additional stops to your plan.  Tried dragging the route pins as described in the help on the company's website.  It doesn't work.  This is one of the most common things I would be doing with a route I created on the Macbook and sent to the iPad.

It showed zooming in on planes and it looked almost as good as a version of flight simulator showing the planes in real time.\n\nI downloaded the app and signed up for the trial. It\u2019s said after 3 day trial I would be charged, And that if I wanted to cancel I could just do so in the settings area.\n\nI found the plane tracker once I had access to be no better than any other free version that I already have.

{"body":"I drive for Lyft and decided to base my decisions on whether to go and wait at the airport on the Arrivals section for this app.  It would say that three flights were coming into TUS by the end of the hour, on time, but no flights would come.  However using the map, I was able to click on all the planes in the state, and could see that none were on there way to Tucson, except a cargo plane, and the ability to do that was awesome!  That gave me the info I needed to leave and stop wasting my time waiting on something that wasn\u2019t coming.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

Yes, I know I can select free trial of full features to get rid of them. But I do not want to go through that hassle, including not forgetting to unsubscribe in 3 days if I don't want it. \n\nThe developer's high pressure business model is flawed and reflects a lack of understanding of his customer. He would get more subscriptions if he allowed the person to evaluate the app in peace without signing up for the free trial. Then after a few days, begin the harassment, if you must. But as it is, it is too disturbing to take the time to evaluate. I write this knowing he is reading these. \n\nToo bad. It looked like it might have been a good about to have. But it is not worth the hassle.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

I freaked and got in the Apple chat and was walking through subscription cancellation. I then deleted the app. I will confirm in three days to make sure I am not going to get call.

{"body":"Used to be awesome, even upgraded to pay version to get rid of ads I used it so much.

{"body":"Please update the airports including the new airports in Maldives and to be able to track Maldivian ( Q2 ) or FlyMe ( VP ) airline flights as currently we cannot track them on this app. Flightradar24 does just fine but I prefer this app over the other app for some features. Hoping for a response from a dev.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Not accurate. Does not track all flights. A large 747 cargo plane can be right over head and it doesn\u2019t even show up on flight tracker. Routes shown on map are unbelievable sometimes.

{"body":"The \u201cfree\u201d version is fully functional but very annoying ads make it quite obnoxious to use. \nI\u2019m very frugal and hate to pay, but Planes Live is worth the measly $7 annual fee. \nAll commercial aircraft use ADS-B and are available to track. General Aviation (private planes) must use it if they wish to participate with air traffic control. \nWe use the app every time one of us is in the air.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Planes don\u2019t show up on the map.

Every 20 seconds another pop up window wants me to do something, buy something, upgrade, or win something.  I can not even find a single flight to track.  A total waste of time!!!  Not worth the download time!!!  It even seems to be forcing me to select multiple stars in this review.  I vote for zero stars!!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I\u2019ve always enjoyed watching planes and flying them myself whether it be day or night. I always wonder where they\u2019re going, what plane I am seeing, its altitude, speed, destination, etc. With this app, you can view all those things. You can track the plane to see its flight path to see if you will see it fly passed you or not. On the other hand, I live VERY close to railroad tracks and freight trains pass every 10 minutes or so. I wonder the same details about them and I\u2019d love to have an app the same as Planes Live but for trains.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Faultless, simple, accurate would be my description for this app not too many months ago. Today the app was inoperable. I needed to track a flight ATL-ORD-CPH. The attempt to input devoured 10 minutes. The app could not find the flight or anything else. Delight became disappointment. These folks can do a great deal better than what I got today. I hate putting this into the public. But how do you contact an app maker directly?  I went to the airline site through Google and had my answer when I touched enter. Then I was asked to pay $6.88 to rid myself of ads. Not their greatest moment in sales. Get back to your former faultlessness, simplicity and accuracy folks. It hurts to experience the failure of a great product.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"The times on these apps are all screwed up. For some reason everything is showing five hours ahead. If the plane is landing at 6:00 PM the app is showing it is landing at 11:00 PM. The same goes for arriving flights, if a flight is landing at 3 PM the app is showing it will land at 8 PM. So if there is a plane in the air it will show the plane on the map but it will not give the speed\u2019s or altitude because it thinks the plane still at the airport. This makes this app completely useless!!!  This has been going on for the last two months.  This used to be a fun app but not anymore.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"For a free app it does the job. Would I spend $ to track planes? Probably not, but when I want to i.d. what kind of aircraft is flying over head it just the thing. When I need to find out when my wife\u2019s flight is getting in to Logan and I can actually see it over Providence it\u2019s a good thing. When I can see cargo flights represented as Santa\u2019s sleigh in Alaska to show the kids on Christmas Eve... now that\u2019s cool!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"So there's an ad or two, what do you want for free?? It's good entertainment, not for hours on end but when you're sitting around looking at the sky or if you're actually tracking a flight. This will do the job, it's not rocket science, most will figure it out. I appreciate it.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Now I understand this is the free version of the app, and we should just get used to money grubbing developers putting ads in the free versions of their apps, but there is a right and wrong way to do it, and this is obviously the WRONG way\n\nThere is absolutely no reason to interrupt the functions of the app to throw in a full screen advertisement, I would understand full screen ads in free games advertising paid game apps...  BUT THIS IS NOT A GAME!!!  It is a tool, tool apps should NEVER have full screen ads...  EVER!!!\n\nA banner ad at the top or bottom of the app should serve their purposes just fine without intruding into the usability of the app, I have used many apps with banner based ads and they work perfectly\n\nThe only reason they have for using full screen ads is to annoy the user enough to download the paid version instead, just to not get the annoying ads, but instead of attracting people to the paid version of the app, it forces the user to look elsewhere, losing business\n\nEDIT: And if full screen ads aren't enough, it's now even worse, now they use in AppStore ads, the ones that randomly opens and switches to the App Store and go to a random game app\n\nIt's as if the developer doesn't even want us to use the app and instead view a bunch of ads, might as well call this app the \"watch ads\" app with a side of flight data\n\nUPDATE: Ads aren\u2019t the only problem, I have also noticed fake flights mixed in with real ones, these are easy to find by tracking the flight, fake flights have no flight data, thus you are unable to track a fake flight, it just shows a line from the supposed start location to the supposed destination location without the plane to track, instead it shows a bunch of other real flights in the area\n\nHow do I know these flights are fake?  Because all \u201cflights\u201d this happens on don\u2019t show up on the flight tracking on my local airport\u2019s website (flycolumbus.com), if flights listed as landing at CMH don\u2019t show up on that site, they are fake\n\nAs for flights that this app does have working real-time tracking status on, lo and behold they show up on the airport\u2019s website\n\nTry it yourself, check the arrivals of your local airport at their website and match it on what is shown in this app, I\u2019m sure you will find fake flights","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"When you start the app, it asks you to upgrade. If you click no, it goes away and planes start to appear. 1 minute later, some crap comes up trying to sell you something. This happens every minute for three minutes. At 3:00, you get the minute ad, but this time when you click \"NO\", the program crashes. Obviously, they HATE taking \"NO\" for an answer.\n\nThe planes don't get a chance to populate the screen before \"SURPRISE!!!\" It's ad time again! \n\nSad, because it has a lot more info than Flight Aware... when it loads.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"This app has way too many ads! What\u2019s extremely annoying is the fact that quite often a full page ad will suddenly pop up and take the entire screen. This full page ads popping up are already extremely annoying. I don\u2019t mind some ads considering the app is free but I feel like these are aggressive type of ads : it takes the entire screen space and it\u2019s often hard to find the little X button you are supposed to click to close the ad.\n\nI think it\u2019s the first or second time I write a review. But this was simply way too annoying and I had to write a comment about it. A little bit advertising is okay but too many ads and on top of this tricky ones are not okay!\n\nUPDATE TO MY REVIEW AFTER DEVELOPER RESPONSE :\nThe developer of the app has answered that \u201cthese functionality limitations in the app are compensated by the fact that it\u2019s free.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that the answer is off topic : I am not talking about functionality limitations but what I consider to be borderline advertising harassment. When I say borderline, I actually believe that the way some of the ads appear cross the line : for example, the ad appear full page and it\u2019s almost impossible to see the close button (the small X) because it\u2019s almost the same color as the ad\u2019s background color.\n\nI don\u2019t mind some ads but not that kind of ads which from my personal opinion is more a form of harassment to trick me to click on places I don\u2019t want.\n\nI also forgot to mention that many of these annoying ads seemed to have been for gambling websites.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The complaints about the number of ads is no fluke. In the few minutes I\u2019ve used this app, I got an Amazon survey popping up in Safari, two game ads that took over the screen temporarily, and a request to download a weather app. Otherwise it seemed somewhat useful.

Worst of all, it drains the battery really quick, in an hour I received 20% battery left warning and iPhone reports the battery as \u201cPeak performance capacity\u201d. If it were mining coins the result won\u2019t be any different. This is supposed to be used by tourists, with limited charging options. What were you thinking?\nI hoped to have a smart guide in the museum, instead I had to spend the rest of the day without a phone. \nAnd apple does not refund this piece of useless add-on. I see the point, it is a guide and there could be many trying to get a refund when their day at the museum is over. But also erodes the trust relationship with apple. What if it really doesn\u2019t work, as in mine and many others case, who is going to defend my right? The next time I purchase something I will remember that if this thing doesn\u2019t work as advertised apple will not be on my side and I will think twice.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app is increasing my enjoyment of the Louvre but needs work. The app takes some tinkering to figure out at first. Then, the you-are-here location dot and \u00ab getting there \u00bb navigation features turn out to be worthless. The map screen is not particularly easy to use manually, especially since the location dot is wildly inaccurate. Next, few plaques in the Louvre have an audio guide number on them that can be typed into the keypad. I can be in a gallery with no audio guide numbers in sight but if I zoom into the map I can see works that do have audio files. Many of those can be clicked on from the map but not all the links work. Then too there are just problems. Les Noces de Cana is one of only three works in the Mona Lisa room yet the audio file number is not listed on the plaque. When I looked it up manually in the search function it asked me if I wanted to download it even though I had already bought the whole catalog. Finally, as others have noted, the app uses an iPhone battery in 3-4 hours, and I\u2019m starting the day in battery-saver mode. Some of this is just the fact that I\u2019m using the screen constantly but the screen also stays on while an audio file is playing. If you hit the lock button the file stops.  The easiest improvement that the developer could make would be to let the screen fade off while listening to audio files. Overall, this is an ambitious app but one that needs a couple hundred more hours of coding to clean it up.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"We got the Nintendo audio guide and struggled for a ridiculously long time to use it effectively, while the phone app was much simpler to use and had all of the same commentary (with the $5.00 purchase). Often the Nintendo guide did a better job of recognizing our actual location, but phone app was significantly easier to figure out how to get from A to B. We were there about 7 hours and we did kill the batteries on both the Nintendos, and my battery backup for the phone meant we were still covered. I wish I\u2019d started with this guide a lot earlier in the day, but we did ultimately rely on both this guide and the rented one.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"Will be contacting Apple to get my money back but - heads up- do not buy this!!!! This is billed as an equal to the audio guide available at the museum. I downloaded the files at home before my visit. At the museum I turned off everything- cell, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc. Still This app had my newish iPhone running nuclear temps even while incommunicado- I\u2019d been in the museum 20 minutes and my phone went from 100% charge to 80. By the way there is a \u201ccharging station \u201c on the printed museum map, and in live signs- it\u2019s not operational. So I rationed what I could listen to and was able to listen to 10 descriptions (these are average two minute audio files) before my phone went completely dead. This app is broken and you would do better to buy the audio guide in person (there was no line on a Monday in September if that helps). I not only missed out on info but it was a huge travel inconvenience as I had destination and translation info on my phone. Unacceptable.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The App is very poorly designed. Doesn\u2019t really tell you how to get to where you need to go to see a piece of art. Even the items in the catalog aren\u2019t sequentially arranged so as to make them easy to find and listen to the description on them. Once however you miraculously locate a work you\u2019re interested in, the description is pretty good. Needs some serious work!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

The Louvre app gets none of the things correct and crashed more than once.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

It begins to down load, then resets before it em gets down loaded.  And it is not as if the app can pick up whereby leaves off.  IT RESTARTS every time!   So we were NEVER able to use this app in the louvre, or even in Paris, or anywhere in France for that matter...  it would not even load, so we could listen to it on the plane as we flew home!   I\u2019m disappointed and feel it was money very poorly spent.  I would like a refund of some kind.   We were not reliant on WIFI, I had a SIM card and had data.  Very disappointed!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"So I went to Versailles before the Louvre and downloaded the Versailles App.  I felt like an adept tourist at Versailles skipping the long audio line. And the guide was very good IMO.\n\nSo I got the Louvre app with a good gut feeling. Here is my feedback on the experience.\n\nPro \n- Great content.  Probably exactly the same as the Nintendo guide you can buy at the Louvre.\n- uses GPS.  I think the Nintendo guide might also have GPS? as I saw people walking around with maps.\n- Cheaper if you don\u2019t want all content.  I just wanted to see the paintings and skip everything else.  They had just the paintings bundle for 2 \u20ac.  Not bad...  don\u2019t know how much guides are at Louvre but I expect a lot more.\n- content goes home with you.  Not the you are going to listen to it once you leave... but you could.  It\u2019s yours forever instead of just renting the content. \n\nCons\n- Audio turns off when you turn the screen off to your phone.  Versailles app didn\u2019t do this.  This means your screen needs to be on and app open.  Wastes a lot of power.\n- Can\u2019t rewind audio.  If you miss something you have to listen to the whole audio again. REALLY?!\n- The paintings bundle didn\u2019t include all paintings!!!  It missed the highlight paintings and s lot of the letter French paintings.  Really?!  I would\u2019ve rather just payed for all content if I had known.\n\nFor me, between the 5 \u20ac app of all content and the official audio guide I think it is a toss up.  I\u2019d probably still get the app over the Nintendo.  I just like using my own phone and headphone and having the content when I leave.  Pretty annoyed about rewind and that some paintings were left out though.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I downloaded the app and purchased the comprehensive guide in advanced, while my husband rented the Nintendo guide at the Louvre. I was really disappointed when we would go to different exhibits and I would put the audio guide number in and it would say \u201cinvalid\u201d while it worked for my husband. I check again to make sure that I downloaded the full audio guide, which I did. Confused I went to information to see if they would assist me, but the gentlemen said he didn\u2019t know anything about the app. I asked if there was some one there who was familiar and he said no. I went to the audio guide desk to see if someone could help me, and the woman there stated that it\u2019s not the \u201cofficial\u201d Louvre app. I told her I downloaded it from the Louvre website. She couldn\u2019t\/wouldn\u2019t help me. I went to another audio desk and the gentlemen said he wasn\u2019t sure either. Needless to say this was a waste.

I understand how that might be hard to differentiate, but perhaps allowing to choose what floor you\u2019re on would be helpful. Also, the directions didn\u2019t work. It would lead me into a wall, literally. Sometimes it simply wouldn\u2019t give me an option for directions.  \n\nDefinitely download the commentaries at a place with strong wi-fi. I stood right by the wi-fi sign and it still took 10 minutes. (And I just did the short one)!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Plus side: you get a whirlwind tour of what the Louvre has to offer. \n\nNegatives: the locator does not easily locate. I thought I'd be able to plot a course for my visit, no such luck.

{"body":"The app doesn\u2019t have info for the majority of the exhibits which defeats the purpose.  The search method is ok, but it would be better to use the numbers provided on the exhibits, like the ones you get at the Louvre.  If I had to do it again I would have just did the audio guide that you can rent at the Louvre- more info and more exhibits offered.  \n\nThe map function is so-so.  It didn\u2019t show where I was, and wouldn\u2019t allow me to search other floors.\n\nMost frustrating was the fact that the audio was a pain to pause, if I wanted to discuss something with my wife.  Also, navigating away from the app (to google something interesting for example)caused the audio to stop and then restart from the beginning when I went back to it.  \n\nOverall it\u2019s good in theory but needs a lot of work.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

Well, first thing I wanted to see were the Dutch masters and they have so little info about them on this audio,I was thinking it didn't work. I saw all the other folks listening to their museum rented audio guides quite enviously while being highly disgusted with this one. Not until I got to the romans & renaissance hall did it start giving me any decent info. \nCons: the informational number sequence on artwork doesn't match with this (I got lots of \"invalid number\"),has a very frustrating non-alphabetical list of paintings, the gps locator not very accurate in telling you were you are in relation to the artwork you're trying to find.\nPro: I get to keep it and listen to it at my leisure. \nGreat idea, mediocre delivery.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"The saving grace of this app is the outstanding commentary. It is lush and generous and illuminating. That alone makes the app a worthwhile purchase. However...\n\nThe technical implementation of this app is a disaster. Without careful planning before your visit, you could actually ruin your experience of the museum struggling to tame this wild beast of an app. \n\nFirst, and most important, it is a terrible battery drain. The phone heated up so badly I could have cooked an egg on it. Two hours of use will kill your battery completely UNLESS you go into Settings and disable its access to everything: Location Services, Siri, Notifications, and cellular services. Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be losing anything important by doing this. The app\u2019s map is useless for real-time geolocation and navigation. And...\n\nThe app\u2019s free content is useless. (I guess you get what you pay for.) The audio guide is worth the extra bucks but you absolutely MUST DOWNLOAD IT BEFORE YOU GO TO THE MUSEUM. The Louvre\u2019s free WiFi network is too slow. I saw all sorts of people struggling to connect and growing frustrated at their inability to load their purchase. \n\nFinally, be aware that the commentaries, excellent though they may be, are only available for ~600 works.  That may sound like a lot but it represents only the tiniest fraction of the 35,000 works on display in the museum. \n\nIt is shameful that the Louvre lags so far behind its sister museums in producing a functional smartphone-based app worthy of its magnificent collection.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I cannot recommend this app, unless you are an art history expert! I found no way to search for a piece of art, except to scroll through each of the 600 audio files!

I asked 3 louvre employees where I might get assistance, and they had no idea.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

Bigger pipe needed. \n\nBack at my room, trying every which way to download (wifi , orange 4G), and still not getting much past 15%. I think it's their servers plus the download software. \n\nHere's a hint or two developers. Break the big downloads into smaller packages. That way users can dribble it out whether on bad lines or from overloaded servers. Next, implement a recoverable downloading process. It's really a solved problem and there's a lot of software solutions out there  to build on. Finally, move your servers to the cloud so you can easily scale on demand.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

Tap in the number and--voil\u00e0--you have the commentary. 600 of them. You are told where to find them, the room and floor, and you are given some suggested itineraries, depending on your interests.

{"body":"I was in Paris two years ago and rented the clunky Nintendo audio guide at the Louvre.  It had a really lousy interface and was not easy to use.  I had forgotten that experience last week when I visited the Louvre again and rented audio guides for me and my wife.  What a mistake!  It was the same very dated device from two years ago.  After an hour, we tired of fighting with these heavy Nintendo devices we turned them back in.  As a followup, I downloaded this app upon returning home and wish I'd had this app for my time at the Louvre.  (Note:  the app and purchased descriptions have to be purchased at home, since the Wifi at the Lourve (and at my hotel) was not up to downloading the 600 Mbytes of commentaary.  However, at home it took only a couple of minutes to install and worked fine.)  Don't worry about the $4.99 cost of the commentaries -- pay it.  You'll have it forever and it is less than the 5 Euro cost of renting a guide at the museum yourself.  I wish I'd had this last week.

We got rave reviews from everyone that they loved the blog and following us on our journey.\n\nWe\u2019d recommend Journo to everyone!\n\nPat & Bill in Arizona","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"If our avid computer using web site building teen can\u2019t use it , it is no good. And yes she PAID for a useless subscription. It claims\nYou don\u2019t. We\u2019d an account to read the blogs. That\u2019s not true. You do. And it is next to impossible to figure out. The app crashes and it seems you have to use a computer for most things. Who even has a computer anymore. It\u2019s phone or tablet. So boo. Thumbs down. You took our money and we had to find a app that actually worked for her to write about her studies in Europe and Asia. Not happy.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I needed a little help getting started. Customer support emailed me back within the day with detailed instructions for the items I had questions about. I can\u2019t wait to use this on my next vacation.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Over all a nice design. Few glitches like not being able to easily insert photos in between others already posted.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"They hide features behind needing to review. UI seems pretty unintuitive as well, with small areas to tap. Update the app for the iPhone X screen size, it has been almost a year since the phone came out.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I just started using Journo and it\u2019s a pretty cool app! Great for sharing your trip with others and finding cool places!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Just starting a journey, but I played around with this app over the past few days, and love it. I can't wait to see how it works on the trip.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We loved the app.  Our trip was a grand success, in part because of Journo.  We journaled each of 28 days.  Our family saw it all unfold.  They loved the scenery and experiences along with us.  Thank you for an app that allowed so much versatility and innovation.  We were able to annotate different events in one day on multiple days.  \n\nThe app allows for journaling in so many ways.  We will use this every time we travel.  Every time!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Overall, it\u2019s a fairly easy app to use, but I would love to have more creative options in designing my posts, the layouts are pretty plain. My biggest complaint is that you can\u2019t have anyone comment on your posts! Also, I really want to be able to work on\/edit a post without having it go live immediately. Sometimes, you need to stop and come back at a later time. This isn\u2019t possible unless you take your ENTIRE journal offline and then put it back on. One last suggestion, when writing a shared journal, it would be nice to see who was posting it at the beginning of the post instead of having to read the entire post to find out who was writing it.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I am trying to use my apple pen and two things\n1) can\u2019t use eraser\n2) can it add to entry. Yo need to make a separate entry and when you do it is separated by a large space.  \nSo disappointed","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"It's a nice app with an easy intuitive interface--though still a little bulky looking. Usable if it were cheaper but the subscription price tagged with the app renders it pretty useless if you're in search for long-term travel blog unless you want to pay $140 for lifetime. At this point it is only sitting on my home screen because of the initial albums I started that I haven't copied to a new app yet. Honestly, you might as well just make a new separate Instagram account for travel and start photo-blogging on there.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Finding a program that Ican document travel, include pictures, video, and share it in social media and save it for future reference was my goal. I think I found it.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I've been testing many travel apps.  This was the first one I've been able to use immediately based on the easy interface and obvious icons. They prompted me for this review a bit early, though.  Still trying to re-size a photo, and I can't seem to make the maps function work properly, but overall this seems great and I'm excited to use it on my upcoming trips.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Wow, this app is sweet. Finally a journal that I can store not just my written memories, but everything else as well. Perfect for any traveler!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I wrote a previous review speaking of some issues but mostly positive. Now we have not been able to receive any posts from our daughter for over a month, and while the developers are quick to reach out to you, the fixes continually promised to both her and her family members, 'next week', have not materialized. She has another month of travel ahead and i don't expect it to ever work.\n\nSo, short summary: worked well for a couple of weeks, then started to have problems, then failed completely.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app is so close to being perfect. The overall layout is eye catching and appealing. I love being able to tell a story and inserting photos and videos where they work. However, this app has quite a few frustrations which cause me to think long and hard before I pay to subscribe. There needs to be the ability to add more than one photo at a time. Adding images is cumbersome and takes too long. My biggest pet peeve is not being able to timestamp my entries. I\u2019ve reached out to support twice and received no answer back. It\u2019s not a huge deal unless you want to create multiple entries for the same day. The map function doesn\u2019t work and neither does the blogging function because the entries are not in the order they should be. I haven\u2019t been able to figure out how to fix it other than opening up my entries, changing something and saving them. Way too time consuming.\n\nIf this was free, I would live with it. I can\u2019t justify paying seven dollars a month or purchasing a lifetime membership with these issues still looming.\n\nSupport...please reach out and tell me how to work around the time stamp issue. I want to love this app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I was so excited to find this app...I was hopeful it would be exactly what I was looking for. While there is a lot I love, it's not perfect and not worth a monthly fee (to me.) First, the pros....It's very easy to use. I love that you aren't limited by the number of pictures and that you can have text before and after pics. I also like having the option to tag my location. Being able to change the font as well as color are also bonuses. Now the cons....which to me outweigh the pros. The major con to me is that I can't download a PDF. This is useful for a few reasons. One is to be able to read it in sequential order. The other is to be able to print a book as a keepsake from our trip. I was excited to order a book from the site that they partner with but the options are way too limited and the books are pricey. After a weekend trip I spent 90.00 on a book that I don't think I will be happy with. I would also like the option of adding a heading or title to entries. And, it would be nice if friends could comment on the entire blog itself and\/or on individual entries. Please add the option to download to PDF and I will be a loyal monthly subscriber!!!\n2\/12\/18 Update: Increasing to four stars. I love the new enhancements! It\u2019s great having my own webpage where people can easily follow my journey. I want to give it 5 stars but am still trying to figure out the pdf export\/printing. Hoping to see improvements there and will update to 5 stars at that point. Thanks Journo!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I invested 4-5 day\u2019s journaling with this app. I liked the interface even though I could only add one photo at a time to my entries (slow and frustrating, but not a show-stopper).   Half way through my trip, the app started freezing up - would not let me edit or make new entries- and eventually, once I got more than a blank screen with a spinning \u2018loading\u2019 data wheel, it started throwing up server error messages.  \n\nNow I have to recreate my journal entries and could not be more frustrated with the app.  Look elsewhere.  This one is a dud.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Love this app! I\u2019ve always wanted a place to put photos and travel journal entries in one place, so my memories are cohesive. The app is easy to use and can even be published for all to see, if a public travel blog is what you\u2019re looking for. I was even able to put in past entries and back date it, so I could have my recent big trip in with my current ones. On top of all that, the customer service is above and beyond friendly and helpful. So glad I made this purchase!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is an awesome app better than any other journaling app I\u2019ve gotten I just wish the app would work when I don\u2019t have internet it won\u2019t load but overall everything else is so cool","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I recently began using Journo for my travel journaling (which I\u2019ve been doing for the past 40 years of traveling).   I previously used another journaling app (no longer supported); Journo is a significant upgrade.  The app is user friendly although it could use some improvements.   I use a Belkin keyboard on my iPad which only works in landscape format while Journo only supports portrait format.   This means I have to turn sideways to read what I am entering. The developers have assured me that landscape format will be coming soon.   I have had several other questions about the app which have been answered promptly and personally; no referral to a FAQ or other genetic solution.  When they add landscape format I will upgrade them to 5 stars.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"The art style and the overall presentation of this app made me really appreciate being able to put thought to forum. I have always enjoyed writing but I fell out of practice a bit as some of my passions died to some necessities of life. The combination of writing and traveling, two things which every person should strive to do if within their financial ability, made me rediscover the wonder of writing. I am grateful.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I have been testing a couple other journal apps, and this one won me over by having video, and having a \u201cwebsite\u201d I can send to family & friends to follow my journey without having to download an app. The \u201clike\u201d feature was important so I know they\u2019re reading it. I\u2019m all about paying for something well made & useful without advertisements. Customer service is outstanding as well. \n\nOther apps I tried I was having some issues with photos not showing, limitations on the amount of photos as well. Just not my cup of tea.

Its sleek and does Maps, photos, videos and drawings. I can share individually or over social media. It even has a publishing feature if I decide to print a hard copy. Journo Exclusives has suggestions about writing formats in case I\u2019m blocked. I\u2019ve been using the Mapbox to display my journeys on social media! Cropping maps is child\u2019s play. I have a business trip planned for the Philippine next month and Journo has a handy Currency Converter which is gonna be really really helpful. Journo is on a monthly fee schedule, but for me its was well worth the purchase.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"If you've ever been moved to write down your daily thoughts and experiences, Journo provides a beautiful interface for doing so.  Create a journal for a specific event and invite friends to collaborate, or create a journal strictly for your own purposes and keep it private.  Add photos or video when something special exceeds the limits of mere words, and then retrace your steps on a beautiful custom map that fills up with pins based on the locations of your entries.  Make something really amazing and then crystallize it all in the form of a printed book you can lay out and order right from the app.\n\nJourno does have room to improve, but they're definitely moving in the right direction, and their philosophy and passion strike me as very genuine. Some features that would round out the app's capabilities nicely would be the ability to edit the geolocation data of your images and entries within the app itself, and the ability to reposition images within an entry without cumbersome cutting and pasting of text.  In one entry I deleted an image via the image interface and inexplicably lost all of my text as well.  This would have been excruciating had I not recently copied the full text to my clipboard.  I was able to paste it back in unharmed, but that could just as easily not have been the case.\n\nAt this time the app is free to download and use for a period of one month, after which you have subscription options which are perfectly reasonable and will hopefully remain so.  I am only too happy to support this project with a modest subscription payment.\n\nThe deciding factor for me - what keeps me coming back to Journo despite the existence of other options - is the elegance of the interface and the obvious love upon which it's built.  I tried several other apps in pursuit of a good fit, and Journo is my choice.  If you love the interplay of words and images in describing an experience, and if you craft your pages like a work of art rather than a quickly scribbled sticky note, then Journo should be your choice too.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"This is a great app for any airline employee who travels On ID tickets on other airlines. Few ideas: allow users to set times for notifications to avoid receive notifications in the middle of the night. \nEnable alerts so when aircraft capacity is changed or flight is cancelled on a flight that we have requested load then we receive a notification about it. \nUse existing data as analytics sources to provide certain trends information on flights load based on routes, season etc","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app has quickly become essential for my commute to and from my base.

Definitely a must have for non rev travel.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is an example of why:\n\nIf it ain\u2019t broken, don\u2019t fix it. \nNewer isn\u2019t always better.  \n\nNew app has issues confirming account.

{"body":"There\u2019s a real issue for larger airlines. It is completely impossible for someone to answer in time because people have automatic bots set up.

{"body":"I like this app quite a bit when checking loads, but wish I could search by flight\/date to see if someone has already requested\/answered the same inquiry. \n\nIf we\u2019re limited by \u201ccredits\u201d, it would be really helpful to have a search function you can breakdown by carrier, date, airport, etc.\n\nFor example, I might be stuck in FRA. It\u2019d be helpful if I could see any recent FRA inquiries so I can just find a way out, etc. Or look at recent UA, LH, etc. flights. \n\nBut when looking for something very specific, it works fine. The credit thing is a little obnoxious but I get it.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Google sign in option hasn\u2019t worked for months. It takes you to an error page describing how the developer can fix the issue but it\u2019s never fixed. \n\nDeveloper suggests using the web version but then you can\u2019t get notifications for requests so it\u2019s impossible to get credits. \n\nI refuse to sign in with Facebook.

Would've given five stars but the app glitches out and freezes a lot.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Unsatisfactory.  Requirement to use Social Media account as a requirement for use provides a window on how usage and data will be harvested. Gave one star for wasting my time. App description should state such req. up front. \n\n\u201cSocial Media Provides us with a good way to verify that people are working for an airline. Secondly it is by far the easiest way for our users to login. It is safe, easy and doesn\u2019t take more than one click, instead of filling out forms.\u201d","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"This a great app for airline employees to check flight loads on other airlines when doing standby travel. Much better than the facial expression availability on myIDTravel. Flights are often available when myIDTravel indicates little to no availability. The app runs slow or hangs up often. Other than that, I love it. Must have for all airline employees!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Very helpful when trying to decide \"What time can I fly in to work tomorrow? What are my airline options? What's my back-up flight? What's my-back up to my back-up?\" Love it!

{"body":"Awesome, best option for getting non-rev loads. Get your requested loads in minutes rather than hours. A must for all commuters.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"StaffTraveler is the new modern day way for requesting and sharing loads on airlines all across the world.\n\nFacebook load requesting can't compare to StaffTraveler. You can anonymously share loads and your request won't get buried by other posts. I've used this many times to make decisions on which flights I will take both in the USA and around the world. I LOVE this app and know that it will be everyone's favorite as they start to use it.\n\nOutstanding customer support and very user friendly.

{"body":"You can buy the $30 version from the gift shop OR you can buy this one and have money left for lunch. This app was great. The narration and embedded videos are awesome, and the gps function worked flawlessly. Our family of six had a great time learning history on the Gettysburg battlefield. Five stars.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was a fantastic app that took you on the audio tour of Gettysburg. It has a few videos too. Loved the GPS feature. Well worth the $!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Doesn't work correctly with iphone 8's plus running iOS 12.1.4. Settings screen display is \"overlapped\" and locked, no changes can be made, and feature where app tracks you on the battlefield doesn't work. All in all, a waste of my money, & very disappointing. I recommend buying a guide book-they always work!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Great app. This hits the highlights of the battlefield tour at Gettysburg. The family enjoyed the content. YouTube links and music were great. We will continue to use this tour with friends coming in from out of town. \n\nMake sure you allow locations always. Next, cell service can be a little spotty in such a rural area, but that is not the fault of the app. Turn on the app and head to the first stop. The map from the visitors center and this app made a enjoyable tour.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"It was rough to find out where to start. We ended up just doing the last 5 parts and giving up. Great idea, with a little more work, it\u2019s a wonderful idea.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Tried using the app on our tour. Followed the instructions on how to use it, but the app never worked properly. Ended up using the auto tour CD from 30 years ago. At least that's reliable.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Did not work, the markers wouldn\u2019t play. No instructions, or clear way to use the app. It kept repeating the same fact and telling me to press the overview button which did not exist. Might as well have just set $10 on fire. Total waste of money.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I downloaded this app after a close friend told me about their trip to Gettysburg. I\u2019ve done a guided tour before at Gettysburg and found it exhausting to stop at suggested spots, but did not want to miss out on the history. It took about 5 hours to get through. \n\nThis time around I went with a group of visitors who wanted to see and learn everything about Gettysburg but were on a strict time frame. The app helped us get to some major landmarks, while still allowing us to hear about the sites we decided to drive through. Great app, would recommend to visitors interested in learning and experiencing Gettysburg in an efficient way.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is my first review but wanted to write this since I almost passed on buying the app due to some negative comments from others - this app was flawless, once we started we never had to do another prompt, it took us to every stop, gave great comments, enhanced our experience - would recommend this app to anyone that wanted to drive Gettysburg in their own car","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Highly recommend using this app for your own self-guided car tour.  The app is easy to use and the signs around town are easy to follow. My grandma and i used this and really enjoyed our day.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I'm sorry I wasted my money. It did not work well for me and I'm surprised by the positive reviews, The information was minimal and it was mostly music. I'd like my $10.00 back. It was not worth the money and it was frustrating to use. You need guaranteed cell signals and these can be intermittent in Gettysburg.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Visited Gettysburg when we were short on time, decided to do the driving tour, found this app on trip advisor and was extremely pleased with the accuracy of the gps as we moved along the routes. Auto tour signs easy to see and keep you on track.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We gave this a two star because it was actually dangerous. The gps did not work correctly and in order to advance to the next sight my husband had to manually reset the tour to the next spot. (He was alone )He had to rush through the music to the next spot and most the time he was past what there was to see.\nWish we could get our money back.\n\nAddendum: I contacted the developer and they have been very gracious and kid and helpful. I have received a refund. Think it may have been user error. So I am changing my review to 4 stars.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Very useful app with a great functionality! It was easy to use and incredibly informative! Definitely recommend getting it, really makes the experience of being in such a historic place even more worthwhile!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I'm not one to write reviews, but I just had to give my vote of support for this app. It worked perfectly, clips played at exactly the right time depending on our location, and were filled with good information. We had it going through the Bluetooth in our car stereo so it was easy for everyone to hear. We enjoyed being able to go at our own pace and spend as much or as little time at each location as we wanted. It was well worth the $10, much better than paying $35 per person for a bus tour where you are herded with a bunch of people you don't know and don't get to choose how much time to devote to each stop. I would definitely recommend it.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app was a great supplement to the auto tour!  $10 beats the audio cd you get in the visitor center for $30.   You get about 1-2 minutes of info for each of the 16 tour stops + some more in between as you drive.  Those who claimed it didn\u2019t work must not have allowed their phone to track gps location like the directions say.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Did the museum and then downloaded this app to do the auto tour. Just let it go and automatically started the next tour spot when we got there. No issues playing over Bluetooth in the vehicle. Great and very informative!  Highly recommended!  Wouldn\u2019t spend the $$$ for the bookstore one.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I went with my family to the Gettysburg battlefield and I have to say usually hanging out with my family is a bit of a chore but this app really brought the battlefield to life and made it a fun experience for all of us. The sounds that play as you drive through areas and the videos made it feel like a virtual reality experience. It was almost like a scavenger hunt too in that we wondered what we\u2019d discover next as we drove to each spot. My family didn\u2019t fight at all because the app kept us all entertained. And I liked that it was self paced and we didn\u2019t have to travel with a big crowd and tour guide. Highly recommend this, great for all ages.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I used the app while traveling with family, and it worked perfectly. It was very helpful, and made me and my family take more advantage of everything there was to see and visit in Gettysburg.\nI also believe the price of the app is fair considering all it allows you to do.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I usually read all the reviews for apps before I purchase them, especially the ones that cost this much. I was a little nervous that I wouldn\u2019t enjoy this experience but I loved the app! I\u2019ve been to Gettysburg a bunch of times, with kids and without kids, walking and tour bus... But this was a very cool tool that allowed for freedom of movement but still related the historical information! I REALLY APPRECIATED THE GPS TRACKER! At first I thought I had to figure out all the details and tracks to play myself, but this really is a self-guided tour! Thanks so much!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Using this app provides an inexpensive, informative, and easy method for to finding your way around the battlefield. Much easier and more fun then leafing through a book while driving or walking. It\u2019s full of information, easy to use, and a great bargain for the money. Especially fun for family use!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Pleasantly surprised by the app and by the tour itself! I felt empowered by the ability to go at our own pace and experience Gettysburg in the morning, afternoon or evening.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I tend to go on trips along and try to save money where I can. This app was just what I needed to explore Gettysburg. I love that each site has a YouTube video linked where you can see a reenactment of what happened. Extremely helpful when trying to visualize. I\u2019m from MS and wanted to learn about what happened in Gettysburg. This app definitely made it more clear and enjoyable. I would recommend it.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This application from my iPad has been a great addition to touring the sacred battlegrounds of Gettysburg. Being able to witness the fields as they were back in the 1860s has brought tears to my eye. The battle came alive in the palm of my hand. This is application is something all Civil War buffs should purchase and use while touring the sacred ground of Gettysburg.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is a bargain for $10! Skip the expensive CD and tours. Hook the app to your car Bluetooth and enjoy the tour with your friends and family. Worked perfectly!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Not sure how old the tech is that some of the reviewers were using, but I had zero problems with the GPS connection. Everything worked as advertised. Great app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Just finished the auto tour today and the app worked brilliantly. Hooked up iPhone to Bluetooth on the RV stereo and it guided us through the whole thing without us having to mess with the phone. App is perfectly priced considering the way overpriced audio CD at the visitor center ($30 as of today). I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019d expect an actual human tour guide for that price. If you follow the auto tour signs starting from the visitor center you\u2019ll have a great experience. I saw some people refer to pics and videos but we didn\u2019t mess with any of that. The audio tour and our own eyeballs were all we needed. Thanks for a great alternative to the pricey options at the visitor center.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I heard from the creator that the maker of the battlefield CDs has been giving fake, negative reviews to this app. I was curious so decided to try it out for myself when my family drove to Gettysburg for the day and downloaded the app to tour the battlefields. We synced it up to our Bluetooth and it was like having our own personal tour guide! I highly recommend this app for an in-depth experience that allows a more immersive and comprehensive tour.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Not sure what is up with the low reviews but I had to come back and say this was amazing for $10. So much better to go at our own pace and not stuck in a bus with other people.  The app provides info automatically by detecting your location and the music is great.  We did end up losing the route for the last 3 stops and I had to navigate there with Google and then the audio caught up, but besides that is was perfect.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is beyond awful. The GPS doesn\u2019t not keep up with the Audio. The audio plays the same things over and over again. Do not spend the $10, you and your family\/friends are better off walking the battlefield and reading the signs than spending $10 on a junky app!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app was so fun! It was our first time in Gettysburg and we wanted to see the major sights without having to take a tour bus. This app gave a ton of info - more than the free brochure from the park, and we found the music really set the mood. We felt like we were on a luxury private tour in our own car. The GPS worked perfectly and automatically played the appropriate audio track as we approached each site. I wish there were more apps like this for other destinations. Well worth the $10.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Would not recommend this to anyone!  Half the stops don't work, not worth using if it was free!  Keep searching!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app should have been priced at $1.99. You will get more information from the free brochure at the visitor center. This app only has limited information about 16 of the sites and neglects most of the major ones. The only reason it may be worth $1.99 Is for the sometimes useful GPS application for those unfamiliar with the battleground.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I loved the audio commentary in this tour. The audio played automatically and the whole family got a guided tour of Gettysburg. Awesome!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Audio tracks don't work. It goes to short YouTube videos instead of audio tracks and those aren't great given spotty cellphone coverage in the area. Also, there is no GPS triggering. Rip-off","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The \"content\" of this app is so weak, the free brochure from the visitor's center was more informative. There was less than 20 minutes of audio content and some of it was inaccurate. Any one of the CDs sets in the visitor's center would be at least an hour and more like 2+ since they had multiple discs.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I loved this do-it-at your own pace, drive and explore tour of the battlefield. The GPS triggers were great and there was so much more added value in the extra content at each stop.  The videos brought the battle to life and the pictures and audio added interesting historical information. I highly recommend this for families and explorers of all ages.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app did work only basic information given could have been more comprehensive the gps concept is good and worked recommend rebooting phone after installing app to get gps part to work smoothly.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I've tried a lot of apps for Gettysburg and this one is by far the most entertaining and interesting.  Most of the other apps are just boring information but the videos in this app really bring the battle to life!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is a great app that is very easy to use.  Download it while you have a good signal, which you won\u2019t have in the park.  It tells you what are the \u201dmust see\u201d stops as well as other places of interest.  The explanations of the park\u2019s geology and the mechanism of geysers was well presented and easily understood by a lay person.  The GPS driven app always knew where you were and which direction you were heading, and adjusted its narration accordingly.  When approaching an intersection it clearly gave all the information needed to direct you toward the sights that you wanted to see.\n\nA minor suggested improvement would an option that could be turned on the give the distance to the next rest facility.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We have told all our friends about this ap. We used it for Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Tetons. It was like having a tour guide in the back seat! The information was spot on and the beauty of traveling at ones leisure can\u2019t be beat. We laughed when we left the parks as we felt like we lost our back seat passenger.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"For some reason, my Googlemaps and Waze weren\u2019t picking up the location of what I entered when I was ready to drive through Yellowstone through to the Grand Tetons. Yet I remembered I\u2019d purchased this app to learn a bit of what I\u2019d be seeing along the way, and fired it up. What I didn\u2019t expect is that this app pretty much saved me!! Because of the GPS awareness, it would preview upcoming forks in the road well in advance so I was confident driving in the direction that matched my overall plan. (Not sure why this worked when the other apps didn\u2019t- but yay!!) I loved that the voice was not always on. I liked that you could pause the narrative too (which I learned after trying to film which videos and hoping not to hear the narrator\u2019s voice while recording. Using another app doesn\u2019t silence the guy.) I really appreciated learning tidbits about the history and the nature I was passing through. A great use of location-based services. Well worth the investment... I\u2019m walking away with greater appreciation for where I drove through or where I chose to stop and hike around...","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We just spent 6 days in Yellowstone & Grand Tetons and we used this app every day. We loved it. It was so interesting & educational. We were impressed with how well the narration was timed with your driving and direction of travel. It worked well with music playlist. Great app!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We used this for our first visit and found it fun and informative. Very useful for deciding where to stop. It kept my 8 year old engaged on where we were and what we could see. My only suggestion is that it would be nice to have reminders on which way to turn when leaving each stop. This is a great way to get around without having to spend so much time looking at maps.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Excellent! We loved having the commentary and learned so much. I would always look to seed if there is a gypsy guide wherever I travel! After listening to the app our 10 year old identified a bird she learned about!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is a wonderful app.  Took us all over the Tetons and Yellowstone.  I think better than having a guide.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This app is a must when visiting Yellowstone and Grand Tetons. It\u2019s like having your own personal guide in your car.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Worked perfectly!  I am obsessive about trip planning. Didn\u2019t need to do anything using this.  I have amazon prime and downloaded a free copy of Lonely Planet Yellowstone and Grand Tetons to my Kindle app as a companion but didn\u2019t really need it.  Would have been useful if you wanted to get into the back country.   This really is all you need !","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is the best guide you could have. I didn\u2019t have to spend $250 per person for a guided tour of Yellowstone National Park. This app guided us the entire way along our route. I would highly recommend this app for anyone.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We really enjoyed this app..great recommendations and we definitely made some stops we might not of and enjoyed them all.  We really liked all the information provided before the stop so we could get out and just enjoy the scenery. Well worth the $10..","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Love this guide. Just enough to make the area even more special. Wish I had it for earlier park visits. Learned so much in an easy, interesting way. Saw things I would have missed and had on earlier trips. Wish I had time to drive all of Yellowstone again.  \n\nPerfect concept to allow total independence yet have advantage of a guide\u2019s in-depth information. Everyone going to areas where a Gypsy Guide is available should have it for sure.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is absolutely amazing. I never write reviews for anything but I had to come back and write one for this... having traveled to Yellowstone and Grand Tetons for the first time last week, this app was so so helpful in all that we did there. The app not only guides you as you are traveling along (maybe having half an idea of what you\u2019d like to do), it gives you tons of background historical and scientific info about what you are visiting. The guide friendly directs you as you drive along and makes helpful suggestions about stops throughout the parks. I really appreciated the categorization of \u2018do not miss\u2019 verses suggested stops. All of this together resulted in us not only navigating the vast parks painlessly, we saw so much more than we would have seen without it. We also learned an incredible amount of history and and scientific side notes that made what we were seeing more meaningful than without the guide. Really impressed by it. Very well done; developed with much thought about what a first time traveler to the park would need. Lots of info; very kind and polite commentary\/ direction as well as very appreciated humor thrown in. Do not hesitate to purchase this app to guide you through the park if you\u2019ve never been. Honestly, it\u2019s like having your own personal Park Ranger in the car with you! And he\u2019s funny and very pleasant to listen to!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I traveled through Grand Tetons and Yellowstone by myself and this guide was amazing, beyond my best expectations! The narrator was excellent!  The history and background stories were so entertaining and interesting.  The narrator let me know what side trips were coming up and when so I never overshot a turn out. I highly recommend this app to everyone!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was our 7th trip to Yellowstone\/ Teton and you would have thought we had seen everything but having this app not only guided us to spots we had never seen but the historical perspective of both parks added so much to our trip. We will certainly use this option on any future trip that is available. Thank you for making this the best trip ever. The Coles.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I never write reviews and rarely pay for apps. This app would be a bargain at twice the price. Completely made our trip. We loved the guidance and definitely experienced things we would have missed otherwise.  Plus we learned some interesting facts. We missed it when we were done. I wish I could have had the narration all the way home.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This was such a great addition to our Yellowstone\/ Grand Teton trip. We would have missed so much without the great suggestions on where to stop and what to see. It was also nice to hear the history and learn about the science in a fun and entertaining way. It worked perfectly and we didn\u2019t have to pull out guide books or keep our eye on a map. We really enjoyed using this and will use this app again for other areas of our beautiful country!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Greatly enhanced the value of our tour of Yellowstone and Tetons.  Highly recommend getting this app before going on this trip.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Just got back from Yellowstone and Tetons.  Had bought many books and highlighted areas that I wanted to see before I saw your app.  Decided to purchase anyway and it was the best thing I did.  The narration is very informative and I feel like I did not miss a thing.  Very enthusiastic narrator on where to stop and would point out place of interest but let you know if limited on time it the stop was worth stopping in his opinion.  Explained a lot of history and information in region that I otherwise would never had known.  Well worth the money....best $10 spent and looking forward to purchasing the guide on upcoming trip to Vancouver.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Yellowstone without using any guide books.  Loved all the history lessons we received.  I would definitely recommend getting this app.  I will purchase the app for the different parks offered on future trips.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Wonderful app!!! Like having your own personal tour guide. We would never found all the sites on our own!! Looking forward to our next trip.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This was a very informative app! We saw many things that we probably wouldn\u2019t have seen without the app. My only complaint is that if you turn off your car to take a hike or just to take pictures, you have to shut off your phone and reboot and restart the app, that got to be a pain.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Just finishing 2 1\/2 days in Yellowstone with this guide and planning to use the Grand Teton guide tomorrow but couldn\u2019t wait to express our appreciation for this outstanding resource. We learned so much more and saw so much more than we ever could have without this app. The information is thorough, exhaustively researched and very pleasantly presented. The narrator is easy to listen to and learn from. Don\u2019t go without this, ESPECIALLY if it\u2019s your first trip to Yellowstone.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We just completed a weeklong trip to Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, and we had done a lot of research prior to our trip. We had a game plan, and it really made the trip smooth and maximized our time. I found this app the week before we left and downloaded based on other reviews...and after using it for the week, I can\u2019t recommend this app enough. It really made the trip so much more complete, and even with our pre-planning and research, the app added so much to the experience, it\u2019s hard to put into words. All I can say is: if you\u2019re planning a trip, don\u2019t go without this app! Can\u2019t wait to try the other tours they have available!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"All I have to say is WOW. This app will not let you down. Worth the $10! I literally have never paid for an app and took a chance on this one,  Mainly because of the great reviews....that\u2019s why I felt compelled to add to them.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"A must have app. Worth 3 x the price and I rarely pay for apps. I can\u2019t say enough good things about this app. Incredibly accurate and an absolute necessity if you\u2019re visiting the parks. I had no cell service or data or GPS signal on my phone so this was a lifesaver.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Wow! So impressed with this app. We couldn\u2019t have made it through the Tetons and Yellowstone without it. Like having a personal tour guide with you every step of the way.  Hope there are more Gypsy Guides because we love traveling. The history and side notes are a double bonus!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Really a great ride-along friend to help you enjoy your driving tour of these great national treasures.  The information was enjoyable, the turn prompts excellent and the overall operation was smooth.  With the spotty and weak cell service in the parks, I can not believe how well it worked.  A small charge for an interesting helpful ride-along.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We loved this app.  Our friend from work recommended it because he had just come back from Yellowstone with his family.  We called the app Martin.  He suggested where to stop and taught all kinds of history along the way.  The map we got from Yellowstone doesn\u2019t list half of the places we stopped and it\u2019s hard to decide what to spend time on.  Martin also helped with parking suggestions.  We knew exactly where to stop and park.  LOVED IT!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Very informative, educational and well worth the $10. It was nice to here the history behind Yellowstone.  This was our first visit and it was  easier to decide what stops you wanted to make based on  Gyspys review.

{"body":"This app was a game changer for our 10-day visit to Grand Teton & Yellowstone. We read several travel books to map out our time in the parks. One publication suggested this app, which we decided to try. This was a huge help as we traveled the parks. The guide, who we named Fred, took us to the best spots, letting us know exactly when to turn, pointed out hiking trails available with distances, and made suggestions on which were \u2018must see\u2019 spots vs ones to be skipped if we were tight on time. Fred educated us about the history of the parks and made suggestions on the best times to see some of the most popular sites & catch sight of wildlife. This app is a must if you\u2019re planning a trip to Grand Teton & Yellowstone!!","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I would give this 10 stars if I could! We learned more about the history and geology of Yellowstone from our Gypsy Guide than from the Park Rangers. It gave us inside tips to beat the crowds, alerted us to turnoffs and sights that were not described elsewhere, and gave us wildlife viewing tips that were right on and essential.  It was like having a park expert in our back seat - plus he was folksy, and amusing - the perfect vibe for Yellowstone.  This GPS technology is impressive - we never lost touch, even in backcountry without any cell service. Well worth purchasing - it will greatly enhance your park experience.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"We just spent a few days in Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons.  This app provided valuable information about the parks and must see stops.  It also provided information about side roads to take that we would not have known about otherwise.

{"body":"We just spent 7 days exploring Yellowstone and Grand Teton using this app. We purchased it after reading about it on a travel blog and it truly enhanced our park experience. Usually my husband is driving and I have my head in a map and\/or guidebook trying to figure out where we are and where we should stop or reading information and missing everything around me. This app did it all. Here were some of our favorite features:\nThe info was in short (max 3 min) bursts.\nInfo covered history, geology, wildlife as well as what were must see stops vs stop if you have time. \nCommentary was interesting, relevant and entertaining. \nCommentary was different depending on which direction of the road you were driving on.\nProvided driving direction choices at junctions. \nReliable. We had only one morning when the app couldn\u2019t find us. I restarted my phone and this small problem was fixed. Other than the app knew exactly where we were at all times. \nIf we could rate it more than 5* we would. A must have for any visit to these two national parks. Genius! Thank you for making such a great product that actually works as described with no obvious bugs. We highly recommend.","category":"Travel","sentiment":"positive"}

Romance feels hopeless enough, without that added twist!!!\n\nThat and the fact that most of the people I contacted failed to respond, and showed absolutely no activity, says to me that once you put a profile on this site, it stays up forever, whether you are no longer active for years. Makes them look good, if they have a lot of profiles, but most of them are ghosts, who were gone long ago.\n\nSo do what I did, everybody: take off all your profile photos and put really dumb landscape photos in, and replace your writing with gobbledygook. Then nobody\u2019s going to be writing to a ghost me!  \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude1d\ud83d\ude01","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I\u2019ve been on OurTime barely a month. \nI have reported and block so many scammers, poor English, their fear of God, giving their email and asking for mine before I even accepted to chat and of course after doing my own Google pic search, stolen pictures... as we all know, once removed they get back on using new pics. This is not acceptable! \nDuring this three weeks, I only went out one time for a drink, chatted forever with two nice men, one truck driver on the road, I guess the site keeps him busy, the other either too shy to ask a woman out or older than his pic... then few phone calls with a nice nice who would hang up fast cause his daughter was at the door... lol... after my own search he was married. Nice conversations though. Others, many from out of State. I set up my profile to be Local but I guess I\u2019m wasting my time having to clear all of those too far from my area. \nOthers men looking like they don\u2019t have a comb or a shaver in their home. We all look for love I guess but seriously??? \nCan the site advice them to post a clean picture. I\u2019ve seen few men posting gross pictures holding a younger girl in their bed... really???? I\u2019m paying to see some trash... \nThis being shared now my question for OurTime is. You get pay by your members for Everything!!! Every options is to be paid for. Shouldn\u2019t each profile be reviewed BEFORE approval?? Pic search, phone real or not, name real or not? I search everyone I meet or talk with for my own safety because of some passed experiences with dating on line. Nice looking men\u2019s pictures end up being unrecognizable once we met or strange men forcing a woman against a car to kiss him, having to fight him away.  yes this is what we deal with and kind of expect off Free sites but I\u2019m paying you guys. So, now I always research before meeting anyone to protect myself. \nIf I can catch every stollen pictures by scammers or whoever making up a profile then why can\u2019t your customer service do the same? Why do we have to report scammers or fake identities? That\u2019s your job and your responsibility. Not your members. We should report bad behaviors or pervert. I contacted your customer service for an issue and I get the same answers as many on here. Report to our customer service. I feel that fake identities should simply be caught before being approved to be on your site. How about blank faces?? No pictures should be on the site at all!!! Why hide who they are. We have to give our private infos to see their faces?!?! \n Safety of your paying members should be considerate #1.\nAs far as I\u2019m concern POF, OkCupid or Tinder are free and I met way more nice and decent professional men, others looking like they\u2019ve been hiding in the wood and need cleaned up, of course those pervert, lonely married, unstable married, fake profile pics, blank faces and horrible scammers. Plenty of mix to keep anyone busy but... it is Free! :) \nI\u2019m happy to leave this site and save my money. \nVery disappointed, not worse the price!!! \n\nAB","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"The current app is glitzy but not user friendly. The information you want about a member requires too much work to obtain and some info is totally hidden from view. My recommendation is that you just visit the website and you will have a better experience. \nAs far as our time goes, prepare for disappointment. I can only give a man\u2019s view but beware, there are hijacked profiles and scammers galore. Pictures of young attractive women are substituted for the original pictures and the hacker takes over the account, receiving and sending messages to anyone and everyone. This is done to either have fun or to obtain personal information that can lead to identity theft. Now, eliminating the scammers and hackers we are left with a much smaller number of legitimate users. I am frequently contacted by women who live out of state even though I have asked that this not be done. They are either hackers or lonely women looking for a pen pal who see this site as a safe alternative to actual dating. Then there are women who are not genuinely committed to meeting anyone but are simply testing the waters at the suggestion of a hairdresser or girlfriend.  They waste the time of anyone who responds to their messages or profiles. I call them toxic though I am certain many will see this as an exaggeration. Some pictures they post are 10 years old and when you finally meet the woman you can hardly recognize her. Some post pictures of their poodles or of sunsets. Often a woman who has not maintained her figure will post only a head shot. As far as interests go, most women say they enjoy fine wine and stimulating conversation. And most claim they enjoy going to the gym at least 5 times a week. \nTo be certain there are nice and  kind women on this site. Whether you will be attracted to them is another story. Attractive women of which there are only a few can afford to be very choosy. Unless you look like Brad Pitt and have loads of cash they won\u2019t give you a second look. Remember the man does the brunt of the driving and spending when there is a date so learn as much about your new friend before becoming emotionally involved. The initial meeting should be brief, casual and for nothing more than a cup of coffee. If a woman demands that the initial meeting include an elaborate meal, fine wine, a Broadway show and\/or a horse drawn coach ride around Central Park, its time to head for the hills. \nI am certain that women who use this site have their own share of complaints about the men they meet. Usually these complaints have to do with sex. \nUnless you opt out your upgraded account is set to auto renewal so please remember to stop auto renewal if that is your desire.\nThe renewal cost is much higher than the initial charge.\nThe people who run the website are not to blame for the abuse that pervades OurTime. They seem like decent folk trying to provide a needed service. The problems are largely the result of bad or misguided individuals who use or abuse the site. \nWhen an average looking guy like me gets a message saying he is the most handsome man the woman has ever seen the message is from either a scammer in Calcutta or Bombay or someone who needs to invest in a new pair of eyeglasses.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

My area (SoCal) is well represented compared to other apps I have used and the men on it seem to be genuine decent guys. It takes a little time getting to know the app but once you\u2019re used to it, it\u2019s friendly and gives a kind of \u201ccoming home\u201d feeling. I have found only one down side: as guys get alerted when I look at their profiles, I then get messages from some of them saying in short \u201cYou viewed my profile so I assume you like me\u201d. That might not at all be the case. As from the page \u201cViews\u201d, the pictures are so small, you kind of need to open the profile to see something. However, I have now gotten to the place where I avoid opening men\u2019s profile who have viewed mine because I don\u2019t want to give anyone false hopes :-\/ Perhaps you can somehow improve that.

Then the people you send messages to are not paying members so they don\u2019t even get your messages.  All the time you have no way to tell who is and is not a paying member.

Not to disparage everyone, but Our Time should at least monitor who puts up what pics. There\u2019s several pics of woman, obviously a mistake. Then there are the gentlemen who have no self-care skills whatsoever. Several men had tattered beards, uncombed\/kemp hair and no smile. Honestly, I\u2019m not sure who would pay for this site and think most of these guys are someone they want to date or spend the rest of their lives with. If I could, I really would coach these men.

But at the end of the day when I shudder as I check my mail and check out my daily matches, I get most excited when I see the spammer is back in the loop again. Run away ladies.

After paying for a full year I am ready to give it up after a couple of weeks, guess Apple figures we oldsters have all the time in the world for this outdated tech. Would rate 0 if possible.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I realize that this app and service is for those of us who are older, but that's no excuse for the app not modernizing to allow for profile editing without going to the actual web browser.

For a woman this is a very safe and practical way of meeting people of like mind and lifestyle.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Created profile and found out you can't do anything unless you pay their high fees to join.  Site will not let me delete profile and I couldn't even delete on their website either. This service is a scam and much better ones for a lot less.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"It's \"free\" to set-up profile. That's it. Forces you to pay to just view inbox. Wildly different subscription prices on website versus app. It's a scam if you do buy subscription because you still cant access inbox. They tell you to wait 10 days. This is a SCAM.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Finally, an app where I meet sincere, nice people and am not constantly dealing with scammers. Oh, they are on here but just start blocking them and they go away. Not all settings are on the app, you need to go to the website to change some things. Probably safer that way. Hope you will consider this app and have a great experience.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Decided to give OurTime dating service a shot since I'm in target demographic and they were offering a 50% discount on a 6 month membership. The service does have people in my age range but the app and web service are pretty bad and need a lot of improvements to get this service to be competitive with other dating sites. \n\nHere are just a few of my complaints regarding app:\n1. Daily matches specifically don't meet my criteria (e.g. Selected option to only get non smokers but get smokers in results)\n2. Add-on services (e.g. Jpeople) aren't accessible within app and use separate website so you have to go to 2 websites when accessing through browser. \n3. Unable to filter daily match criteria.\n4. Unable to filter distance by miles from my location. \n5. Constantly upselling in app when moving between pages. I'm sure a lot of folks end up signing up for add ons they didn't intend to. \n6. Member photos don't always show up. \n7. People don't fill out profile info. App should force minimal amount of info for allowing a profile on site. \n\nBottom Line: Good idea to have dating service for folks over 50 but poor execution. This app and service need a lot of work to get OurTime to be a dating service worth joining. I won't be renewing my membership when my 6 months are up. \n\nIMO POF has a better app and it's a free service.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This site is a complete waste of money. Nothing but spam from bots with an email address or number in the pic.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Luckily I didn't pay for any services on this app. You can't see or do anything without paying for it.

No matter how many times I check the settings I get women ranging from +20 to -20 years of what I am looking for. Also not sure what good it does to put in your zip code because I get matches from all over the country. Additionally once I say no to a lady I would think it would keep returning that person on the searches. Overall I am disappointed with the service.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

I keep getting the same people in my daily matches. Or matches with people out of state. Seems to me like the user base is small and the app features are limited. They also wanted to charge me more money to promote my bio and put it one the front page! What a rip off I paid $75  On iTunes for a 3 month subscription then you want to charge me more. Needless to say I won't be renewing. I never write reviews but I thought maybe I can help some one from making the same mistake I did by paying for this.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

If you are a male heterosexual, you will get other guys in the recommendations they send you. They will send you emails even when you have turned all emails off. They will not refind your money, even when they are in the wrong and have violated your preferences. GO ELSWHERE! DO NOT USE THIS APP!!","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I'm having a hard time updating my profile it won't let you edit within the app. \n\nIt shows the same people over and over even if you've \"Xd\" them.

Should be called \"Our Fail\".","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

But It's actually a sneaky scam to get you to think tons of women have\/are viewing your profile and even flirted with you.

So, don't waste your time with any of it, website or app. \n\nThis app has the potential to be great but the functionality is a bit inconsistent here and there.

{"body":"I just signed up at our time and the website is bad enough as it is so busy with too many things to click on, but the app is ridiculous! It shows the same people over and over again even though I've clicked either yes or no. It's embarrassing when you click someone that you don't recall clicking on before and they remind you that they already declined your flirt or whatever. Plus, I'm getting matches that are 15 to 20 years older than myself! Or they're at 2 to 4 inches shorter than I am. Customer service is ridiculous, they won't email you back.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

It's all garbage.\n\nAnd you cannot change your account or profile in the app. !!!! They charge $15-40 per month, and you have to go to the website to make a minor update to your profile or cancel your account. \n\nDon't get me started on the website... it may be an experiment in chaos theory...","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

No sense trying to match me up with a smoker when I said non smoker.    Just feel it could be made much more user friendly. Otherwise, it works as designed.

Don't forget to check the 'Don't use my photos on other websites or Internet searches' box or your images will be out there too. Forget inputting your preference parameters because the service will ignore that and continue to send you the same unsuitable matches that you have rejected each previous day. The app functions are limited and you have to sign on to the actual website, not mobile site, to update or change anything. The 'help' feature is almost impossible to find - tiny link at bottom of home screen on full website only - not in menu. You get a lot of promising matches when you first join then after you pay, most all of those quality- looking 'matches' disappear. An inordinate amount of profiles have the exact same 'about me' write up - literally dozens of my 'matches' \"play flag football on a rec league!\" Some of those guys were very large smokers who obviously didn't even get up out of the recliner to fetch their own beers. Bathroom selfies, photos to show how hot their daughters are, their fur babies, posing by a luxury car, their house, group photos so you don't know which guy it is, fuzzy photos, photos of their younger self and even their childhood photos abound.

Username and description remained the same. Account 2 changed from a black man to a white man in less than 2 weeks. Username and description remained the same AND the email sent to my inbox was EXACTLY the same text after the picture changed. Account 3 had a partially cropped photo but all 3 description sections matched my interests and hobbies with some of the wording in different order. The wording was such that I suspected a computer program had generated these descriptions. Ourtime does NOT have a customer service phone number. My email for a request for a full refund was replied to with a canned response for me to 'go look in the FAQ'.

{"body":"So far this app has bee okay.  My major complaint is there are no app icons or other notifications to let you know you have a message or something.  You can get emails, but sometimes it's HOURS after the message has been left.  But you turn those on through the website, not the app or settings on your phone.  Most other apps have notifications.  And I'm with the other reviewer.  You can't do anything much in the app.  You can't even view\/edit your own profile.  You have to the web site. Yes, it could stand some improvements.  I've asked for a certain age range and general location.  I get guys in their 70s and from other states, not even close at all. What's the deal with that?","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"neutral"}

The site is poorly designed...and the app makes the site look streamlined.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Swiping the same photos every day... Can't see messages or much else unless you pay...match criteria seemingly ignored .... That horrible Grindr app is better. \nEvery time you try something you get sent to the payment page. I got 3 emails within 2 minutes of signing up- my profile hadn't been completed yet. I'm sure at least one was a \"welcome to Our Time!\" email, but seriously, I had to pay to open it? Or an app bot- like I said, I hadn't finished my file. I've also been receiving one \"flirt\"\/day since joining. No more, no less- exactly one. And yes, I'd have to pay to see who's flirting. That's not so bad- I understand they want to make money. It's the precisely one per day (the first arriving as soon as I opened the account) that is highly suspicious. Well that and the other writers who broke down and paid only to STOP receiving flirts and emails. \nOh, you have to go to the website to delete it. \nSorry, fellow mature men, this is a horse that won't run.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

I met a few people so I won\u2019t totally disregard the whole site. I have 1 month left & based on the reviews, I will probably end my subscription.

Hint...take a look at other sites. Not as clunky or messy. All of the flirts, likes, favorites, messages can be overwhelming! It\u2019s just too much since it\u2019s not organized correctly and you get a notification for every single one in a different place. And I swear I set my age preferences and that does NOT prevent  men outside that range from contacting me so I have no idea the issue with this app. \n\nAnd now we can\u2019t log into the app because of some network issue? Waste of money.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I paid $38 for a package on this app that I can\u2019t access and cannot get any contact information for customer service. The one day I did have access the site is counterintuitive and was impossible for me to add my personal details. I\u2019m convinced the positive reviews were written by people at their company. This app is probably the worst app. I\u2019ve ever purchased. If I could reach customer service I would demand a refund.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"As a paid subscription me never, I have to say the interface of this app is horrible. I remember being a member in 2008 when everything was driven from a desktop experience rather than a mobile app. And in 11 years there have been no updates compared to other dating apps. Each morning I go through my daily matches and within 2hrs I am presented with THE EXACT SAME matches again. Also the low response rating is based on me not responding to people I am not interested in who don\u2019t meet the requirement of at least being local. As a woman navigating this site, you\u2019re doing a terrible job. I rejoined hoping for a better experience than Tinder or Bumble but alas, it is no different.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Black people meet is filled with some pretty decent people I\u2019m sure. I have conversed with some nice ladies here and there and I am overall satisfied with the rapport I have built there. Outside of that, I am a little disappointed with how things work on the site. For instance whenever my subscription is at an end I get flooded with emails and winks and flirts that I never got when I was paying. The fact that the designers would think I\u2019m stupid enough to believe that 50 women all of a sudden became interested in one day simply insults my intelligence. The next thing that bothers me is that I always get feedback from women that I never flirted with or never saw before which is disturbing to me. This means that when I swipe or interact with the app in any way it is communicating with people behind my back. This puts me in a very awkward position because I\u2019m not a mean person but sometimes I have to just delete interactions with people that I never talked to in order not to get him false hope. I get bludgeoned when people are not interested in me and I take it in stride, but I\u2019m not really the type of person to drop a load of bricks on somebody or lead somebody on so I don\u2019t talk to them at all. I wish that they would just run an honest business and stop trying to scam people.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

I will be cancelling at the end of my subscription. It\u2019s a waste of money. I can get the notifications but I have to wait until I get home to see my messages... sad..","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

I just downloaded the app yesterday and I already cannot log on. I was using the app then it just automatically logged me out and I can\u2019t log back in and have to use the website which isn\u2019t very user friendly especially from a phone.

I have blocked a few people because I don\u2019t want them to contact me any longer; no big deal. But because a man contacted me and didn\u2019t like my comments, he called me a *itch.

BPM should make sure these men are legitimate we as members should not have to deal with fraudulent folks.  This is a dating site for mature people.  This kind of nonsense gives BPM a bad experience.  I personally would never use this site again.  I also requested ages between 65-72 and got responses from men 50-55.  Some of the pictures of the men were ridiculously displayed.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

However, from my day with this app, I\u2019m pretty disappointed.\n\nNo tutorial:\nThere is no tutorial on how to navigate the app. You basically have to figure it as you go, which means liking pictures, saying you\u2019re interested and viewing profiles with out knowing what the men see on their end. I think that\u2019s in poor taste. It\u2019s a dating app, so yes we are all here for the same thing (perhaps) but without a working guide, FAQ or something to inform of you of how it works and how to get through the process, you\u2019re left stumbling in the dark. \n\nMessages:\nThere\u2019s no time stamp on the messages that you receive. What the heck! I woke up this morning and had a few messages but had no idea when they were sent! That\u2019s irritating. \n\nAbout me:\nI quickly set up the app and chose the standard about me section about being funny etc. Now that I\u2019ve paid for the month of service and have used the app, I cannot find where to change my about me and customize\/personalize it. That\u2019s absurd! That means I had to take the time to do that in the moment? HAD THERE BEEN A TUTORIAL! (Smh)\n\nBlack excellence:\nCome on Black People! It\u2019s 2018! We got this! We are educated, savvy, creative and downright magic! There should be an attention to detail when it comes to helping us find each other. That\u2019s just basic! Please do better.

The rep then told me that there was nothing for him to do because he don\u2019t see the renewal and to call App support again. The App Store refunded the money and then they wanted me to try the renewal again. I attempted to purchase the renewal again in which it accepted the payment and didn\u2019t restore the app. So now I have paid $38.99 x2 for an app that won\u2019t give me full access. \u201cPeople Meet \u201c the developer still has not reached out to fix my subscription status.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

It\u2019s true the older men over 50 hit us in our 30s often, they are the only ones to write a real message too. The last draw and me canceling my profile 15 days in was when Black people meet deleted my profile summary because I mentioned I pay.

I didn\u2019t use any offensive language in my profile and I\u2019m very respectful. When asked why they deleted my profile greeting I got very vague answers. The customer service I received was intolerable, so therefore I cancelled my membership. When asked for a refund I was denied and I only subscribed for a total of 7 days out of a 3 month subscription. What a joke! Don\u2019t waste your time or money! You will regret it. The features on here are useless. They don\u2019t ask you any match-making questions, so how is this a dating app??? I have been on other dating sites\/apps and this was my least favorite.

This app is not even fully developed but I need to pay ? TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE? No sir.

There are free dating apps such as Tinder and Bumble that far exceed Black People Meet when it comes to quality, functionality, and search criteria. This app seems like something a beginning app developer just threw together and slapped a fee on as a way to make quick easy cash. The developer clearly had no integrity. The preview I saw that made me decide to try this app in the beginning was definitely deceiving. Search criteria and preference means absolutely nothing. The app will still show you babies and old men. The flirt and favorites option are pointless, the app allows user to create profiles without a profile picture or profile information (creepers), and there is no matching based on the preferences you selected. One is better off finding a more legitimate dating site because this one is not it. Save your money and look elsewhere.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

If I say no to any match, that should be the end of it. Don't show me that person again. \n\nThe way the website is constructed you accidentally send flirts just by scrolling. Terrible design. Then scrolling through the matches, without going into their profiles, shows that person you've been on their page which is BS. \n\nThen trying to go through pics without hitting an ad is a problem. Trying to view pics in general is irritating.\n\nThis is a horrible site all around. I'm going to remove the option for automatic renewal, but of course I have to go onto my computer to do it because it won't allow me to do it on the website using my phone which makes no sense.

You can use your phone web browser as work around but it's a hassle. I've yet to receive push notifications even though they are enabled in my operating system and through the app. You cannot use all profile descriptors to filter the search (e.g. Education, location).

{"body":"Notes...I have a million of them. So, I joined this site less than 24 hours ago. I paid for the 3 month premium option which is $30+. Fail on my part because this site is full of bots. Before my profile was even finished I had messages and likes from a profile in Plano, TX. I live in Cali. Almost everyone that messaged, flirted, or liked was from across the country. Then when I put my criteria in which clearly stated I wanted matches near my area people from around the country and out of my designated age range still kept popping up in my matches. As I started browsing I noticed that there were profiles with the same pics and different bios and the algorithm is so sloppy that it showed me two profiles with the EXACT SAME BIO...WORD FOR WORD. Do they not think we're smart enough to figure it out or do they just not care? Also how many people are really putting \"fun\" in front of their name. Sad. Now I'm stuck with all these bots for three months.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Sorry I paid for this service. The app is horrible. I have to physically log into a computer to use all the features.

I have setup my email preferences but it doesn't matter because I still receive an email for every like, comment, message, flirt, and view! TOTALLY ANNOYING!  I have put in my criteria of who can see my profile yet I still have people from all different ages and across the whole US contacting me.  SO AGGRAVATING .  You can't even edit your profile from the app! You have to physically log into a computer to do that.  This app and website is worse than the AOL dialup days.

Once you \"x\" a person under Today's Matches or Search then they shouldn't continue to pop up. I'm not going to magically change my decision that someone isn't my type just because every time I log on they're in my face. \n5. If I have set my search criteria, then I want to see who all pops up whether or not they're geographically close to me. I have to search individual zip codes in order to find someone who fits the bill and yet... that's EXACTLY why I paid money to be on the site - so Black People Meet could be my intermediary search engine.

With this being a paid service, I expected much more!! I could have kept my money and used a free app! I know better next time. Oh, and after you select \"not interested\" on someone's profile, they keep showing up. I literally come across the exact same profiles every day with the exact same number of results.

Avoid if you want to ever have a real date.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"There are other actual free dating sites. \n\n1) don't give them your credit card\/debit card information. They will overcharge you. Google it. Several people have been charged for their initial month + more even if they've only agreed to one month. \n2) customer service is neglectful. Try messaging them for a refund and they do not respond. It's a big scam, not even created by black people. \n3) You get to see who views your profile and how many times they view it. That's it. That's the free part. You pay for viewing who favorited you, who liked and\/or commented on your picture, who messaged you, who \"flirted\" with you, and who \"yes\" Ed you (yes vs no on the \"today's matches\" activity. \n4) They remove your content if they don't like what you posted. Save a draft in your notes on your phone after you write your \n\"About me\" and other sections. They deleted ALL of my info. The last time I had the profile, they would just remove a section. This time I woke up and everything was wiped out. I remember typing \"I can't receive messages on here until I pay\" and they took that down. They even crop things from your photos if they feel the need to. \n5) when you upload pictures uncheck the box below it that allows them to share your pictures. It checks itself automatically with each upload. \n6) Fake generated messages and likes are made to stroke your curiosity so that you'll pay. Those 10 messages might not be 10 at all. \n\nOverall, this place is a scam. Be wary of married men and fake profiles lurking around. Some even work for the company. If you have extra money to blow and are bored with life, load a prepaid debit card and have at it. Just load enough to pay for what you want and spend the remainder elsewhere so they can't take your money. The creator of this site also presides over a couple of other dating sites as well. OK Cupid being one of them. You can message for free there. \n\nGoogle reviews on black people meet. They're informative and they may help you change your mind on purchasing.

{"body":"You'd think that an app called black people meet would give you the best chances to meet a good black woman but it isn't. I had more activity on POF and it was free. First off, there's not many black women who use this site. So the same black women will pop up constantly. Secondly, you can't do anything on the site but complete the initial set up before being forced to pay. And page to pay makes it seem as if there's a trial period and small payment to pay every month but it's a lie. You will be lured in to paying $65 for 6 months and there is no refund policy. Even in my case where I wasn't able to gain access to my old account and forced to make a different account. A day later they helped me without getting the original account up and running where I was offered the same subscription for 50% off. Even though I just paid on a new account the day before they still didn't award me a refund or offer any accommodation. \n\nIt's disappointing because in the real world blacks are exploited and you take something we hold dear in the cyber world and dating community and we still get exploited even when trying to support each other on a black dating site. It's quite pathetic and distasteful. I'm just disappointed. Again, even if you have the money to be exploited just know there isn't actually many black women on here to choose from.

{"body":"After using this app for only 30 minutes, I quickly realized what people were talking about in previous reviews. Right after creating an account, I was kicked off and could not log back in because it kept saying my login info was wrong (which was not true). Once I was finally able to access my profile again, I updated the information and posted a picture. When I realized I was displeased with the site, I attempted to take down my picture and close my account but could not. I attempted to follow the directions given on their customer support page but had no success.  The directions were completely irrelevant. None of the keys it said for me to select were even available on my page. When trying to find other avenues of assistance I was given the run around and continuously ended where I started...at their customer support page with irrelevant information. I finally sent an email but received an automated response. Usually I receive these as a confirmation that my concern was received. Not the case here. It was an automated response basically giving me the same directions that were given on their customer support page which didn\u2019t help me to begin with.  The automated response then stated that if the email content did not help, I would need to reply back to it.  Since when do people respond to automated emails? Now I have this account with my picture on it that I can\u2019t take down. I don\u2019t trust this company to help me at all based on what I\u2019ve been through. From what it looks like, this is owned by Match.com. I will be sure to never try that site either, especially if it is anything like this one. Don't waste your money. You will be extremely disappointed you did. I feel that any positive ratings on this app are from people at the company trying to make this product sell.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

I don't receive notifications when I have messages and I'm unable to make changes to my profile within the app. Instead, I have to login to the website on my laptop in order to make changes, which is a complete pain in the butt. My membership ends in late September and I definitely won't be renewing. I wouldn't recommend this app, not at all. The money I spent for membership was a complete waste.

Better chance at learning Chinese.\n\nDon't waste your time or money!","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app does almost nothing that it should. Click \"edit your profile\"? It instructs you to visit the website. Click \"help\"? It instructs you to visit the website. It doesn't even offer you a link to the website when it instructs you to visit the website. You have to get off the app and go to into the website through a web browser. What's the point? You literally have to go into the app every time you want to know if you've received a message because the only notifications are a million emails in your inbox. New messages from the same person are literally new messages, not added to the old thread. And so far the site has been fairly useless because almost everyone contacting me is from out of state. No wonder they discounted their service so much...","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"K, couple of things... #1, your app is PAINFUL to communicate through. There is no notification that pops up on the app when I have a message, likes on pictures are considered messages, which is stupid and just clutters my inbox. Every time someone messages back, it starts a new line of conversation instead of condensing it into one thread from each person which, again, clutters my inbox. In order to have a smooth communication experience, we have to give out our personal numbers to communicate and since you don't perform any background checks to spite the outrageous monthly fee is sets the stage for potentially dangerous situations. Secondly, what year are you in that you think only being able to edit our profiles online is acceptable? Let's get something straight, whatever you came from you are no longer a website. You are an app or you are dead in the market place... end of story. I don't mind paying $35\/mo for a dating app but I have a fundamental problem with paying for an app that can't put together bare minimums in user experience. Get a clue.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I've been using this site for a little over a month now. At first before I cracked and paid, all I could do is see others profiles and read them. You can't message people, see who's viewed you or anything else unless you've bought a subscription. Once I paid, I started messaging people through actual messages and chatting with who is online. On very rare occasions I have gotten responses, I'm still hopeful to find someone on this site. I wish the app let you chat with who is online like using the desktop version. A chat option should be added to the app.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Just like another user, I was tricked into buying 6 months instead of just the 1 that I wanted. The site itself is poorly designed and just shows the same people over and over. The app is far worse. Anytime you want to change or update anything, it forces you to go to the site and the mobile site is the least user friendly experience. I've tried to change my primary picture 3 times and it doesn't change or even move my desired picture closer to the front. DO NOT use this. Once my unfortunate 6 month period is over, I'll never use it again. Biggest waste by far. Lastly, when you get alerts about people who are interested, it spams you and if you happen to like someone and swipe right on them, it makes you look like a crazy person cause it sends up to 3 notifications to the person. This whole thing is a sad joke. I wish I could be refunded.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

This is one of those companies that really hides the fine print when billing their customers and they will do nothing to rectify it. They are all too happy to take your money.\n\nBottom line: this is one of the worst dating websites out there.

It would be a lot easier to send one notification to all friends in a feed. :) I've met some awesome people.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"The app is pretty easy to use, but can be confusing at first. I like how the website has the number of times a person has viewed me or how many times I have viewed them. Maybe that can be added to the app as well. I don't like how the first thing that pops up is profile pictures with no information as to age or location and it's the same people every time I open the app, which notifies the person that I viewed them, when I didn't. Please fix that. Maybe start the app with who as viewed me?","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

I bought it and tried it multiple times over a few days and it never loaded. Every time i tried it would look like it\u2019s going to load and then the app closed out. Needless to say.... i want my money back. The app does not work.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I spent 7 bucks on this app - it\u2019s total scam. Payed version provides you \u201cTop List\u201d, which supposed to represent the list of people who visit your Instagram account often, thus this kind of list cannot possibly change values it shows multiple times in a short period of time. What i mean is, if there are 10 people who go to your Instagram often - if you reload that list five times in 5 minutes - you should see the same 10 people. But you actually don\u2019t. List updates every time with almost completely new options. This is a scam, don\u2019t pay for it.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

I hate people","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

Then I went to go see who blocked and tapped the \u201cget notifications\u201d and a little thing appears with a list of how payments and how long they last.

You log in and they won\u2019t let you see even 1 person without paying so this is false advertisement. Also once you log in they add people to your following list forcing you to follow strangers on Instagram. They are probably running one of those pay for followers scams and use this platform as a way to get those peeps their new followers.

{"body":"Well-designed and easy to use. \n\nSome good features:\n\n1) Unlike most calling apps, contact phone numbers are imported with any custom labels you entered in your iPhone. \n\n2) Unlike most calling apps, the menu bar appears at bottom of almost every screen including the keypad. This makes navigation easier and more intuitive.\n\n3) At top of the keypad, your credit balance appears along with a \u201cBuy credit\u201d button. This is a helpful feature that most calling apps don\u2019t have.\n\nHere are 3 suggestions to make this app even better:\n\n\u2014 in Contacts, display the calling rate next to each phone number. Calling apps such as Skype and Vonage have this feature. It\u2019s helpful to see exactly what the rate is before you initiate a call.\n\n\u2014 At top of the Contacts screen, add credit balance and Buy button in the same way they appear on the keypad.\n\n\u2014 On the keypad, display the calling rate after a phone number is entered. Calling apps such as Skype and TextNow have this feature. It\u2019s helpful to see exactly what the rate is before you tap the call button.\n\nAdding these 3 additional features would help make this a truly 5 star app.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"yubo is a fun app and i appreciate its ability to function without crashing or pressuring you to buy a premium version like lots of other apps, as well as the simplicity of it altogether. however, there are TOO MANY KIDS setting their ages as much higher than they actually are. I have my age ranges set for 16-19, being as i\u2019m 17 years old. more often than not, i see kids with their ages ranging anywhere from NINE to fifteen years old who set their ages higher in my feed. not only is it irritating because i do NOT want to be their friend and those age filters are there for a reason, but it\u2019s also a safety concern on their part, since they are making themselves much more susceptible to predators.\ncreators of the yubo app: PLEASE take a look into this and do whatever you can to keep kids from lying about their ages. i\u2019m close to getting rid of the app altogether.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

All these problems are fine but there\u2019s one problem that is seen from very far away. The customer service and help for this app. I was device banned not to long ago for what reason still hasn\u2019t been brought to light for me.

The amount of hate on this app is almost unbearable, and that\u2019s coming from a guy that enjoys banter. There are also many issues involving the app crashing or not loading anything at all. I notice many times if you move to much on camera, or there are simply too many people in a live, it will lag or shutdown the app entirely and then you have to find whoever you were talking to once again. Another problem I have is the connectivity issue. 80% of the time when I start the app it is fine. The other 20% nothing will load. This will also happen randomly when I\u2019m already in a livestream.

{"body":"it\u2019s overall a great app however i wish there was a way to say \u201cstrictly stay in this age group\u201d when it comes to swiping bc mine will never stay in that age group\n\nalso the notifications when clicked on bring you to the app without the said notification\nex. someone saying \u201chey\u201d and then going to your messages and there are no new messages; you have to restart the app to refresh the page half of the time and that can get pretty annoying","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

The connection to internet is the main one, after a while even if I\u2019m connected to WiFi with almost all bars of service it just blocks me from connection at all and I can\u2019t swipe or text anymore. Hopefully this can be fixed then I\u2019ll give five stars! Also, I believe the adds should not be shown in between peoples photos. Maybe before you see a new person, have the add as its own thing.

{"body":"I first got the app when it was called Yellow. I got it back two years later to a whole different set up and it being called Yubo. At first, the app was very efficient and ad free. However, after i have swiped on profiles, the same ones will come up.  I see less new people and more of the people I\u2019ve already swiped on.  Also, about one ad per 3 profiles pop up. It\u2019s not only annoying, but time consuming to click out and I believed Yubo was supposed to be ad-free. Lastly, the app store says this app should be used for 17+ years of age, but in the app 17 years old is the maximum age. Doesn\u2019t match up. I have become displeased.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Yubo was, for much of the time I used it, an amazing app. However, with what I presume to be a recent change, pop-up ads are now appearing on profiles as you swipe.\n\nMe, and seemingly everyone else on the planet who uses the app, are hating this change.\n\nWhen swiping on profiles (which in 98% of the time) you will often accidentally click on an ad (which is CONVENIENTLY placed where your thumb will be), redirecting you off the app and onto a page you wanted nothing to do with.\n\nAs of this time, there is no way to remove the ads so you are stuck with it indefinitely.\n\nThese ads should honestly be part of r\/assholedesigns\n\nUntil this is changed, I cannot recommend the app to anyone and will certainly not be using it as often, if at all.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Most people on the app only want to talk over Snapchat or whatever social media. The app also randomly \u201csuspended\u201d my account for \u201cviolating\u201d their guidelines when I had done nothing wrong.

{"body":"I like the app a lot and it\u2019s really nice and cool but for the next update you guys should add questions so everyone can answer and if you are similar with someone they be put in the swipe column.

{"body":"I like the app, you can meet some really cool people. Like I have, but one of my biggest problems with this app is the amount of children on here. I know that technically where all kids but when you change the settings in the live and change the age range of people you want to see in the suggestion thing to 18-20. You only want 18-20, but you STILL get 12 year olds trying to get into a relationship with you or trying to get nudes. It\u2019s just a whole problem, it discourages you and now you winded up deleting the app. I don\u2019t know if there is something that you can do about it ,but I just wanted to say something because I don\u2019t know if anyone els has.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Been using Yubo for awhile. Met my girlfriend and a few previous ex\u2019s on it. There\u2019s a glitch where you swipe right on someone and then they appear again. But.. My main complaint is that you can ask for people within 30 miles of you but you don\u2019t just get that. The 30 miles makes it to anyone in the world will appear. So really it doesn\u2019t help.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"The old Yellow was so much better. Yubo now feeds off of fees. I find it very unfair that you require us to pay a fee to see WHO ADDED US. The whole point of this app is to meet new people. Why must we have to pay for that? Perhaps a membership fee should apply to turbo swipes and reverse swipes, but not to see who added you. Also, Yellow was created for teens. Why in hell would you believe we'd pay to see who added us? We don't got that type of money to waste. Also, please fix location algorithm. I set mine to 18 miles, and I have yet to see anyone who lives in the same state as me. I find it very hard to believe Yubo users do not exist in my area; I have many friends who own the app. Please listen to us. Don't wait till people start removing the app to make changes, because I promise you they won't come back.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The good thing about the app is that it\u2019s good to make friends all around the world. I became friends with so many people on the app. The bad thing about the app is that I got banned for some odd reason. I used it for a while but I stopped using the app cause it got boring. After I heard that the app was good again, I tried to sign back in but it said that I was banned for some odd reason. One another reason why it got boring is that people there are catfishing, using it to promote themselves like premium snapchats for inappropriate content, asking for money for S*X, and people being rude for reasons like people not buying there premium snaps and other things too.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"At first I thought this app will be full of f boys wanting nudes from 15 unheard old girls, I was not wrong. There are plenty but blocking is really easy on this app, plus u can put up filters for swiping like what country you want to see or the age groups 14-17 or less also you can meet a lot of new people, usually I just put up the setting for swiping is to only see females idly I just want more female friends. But I do recommend it literally I made 3 friends in about an hour, now I\u2019m snapping  them everyday lol. Plus security on this app is really good.

{"body":"Was excited when I heard about the app. The swipe feature continually moves so you can\u2019t ever look at photos or read bios without your screen shaking. Also your ages should be very obvious next to your name. I\u2019m 20 years old, some younger profiles as young as 13 try to message me not realizing I\u2019m a young adult. It\u2019s set up in a way that make it easy for predators to access teens. The whole thing reminds me of tic toc and has a strange setup. I\u2019ll keep using it and see if I end up liking it.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"when i first joined yubo (yellow at the time, still like that name better) i met some cool people and made a few friends and it was great, but slowly everyone i matched with were just swiping right on everybody and asking for nudes. eventually conversations would just be back-and-forth \u201chey\u201d and no one cared about making friends. of course i can\u2019t blame the devs for how people use the app, but here\u2019s an idea: maybe when people sign up there can be a few questions asking roughly what relationships they\u2019re looking for in the app and streamline those who answered similarly in the swipe page (something like romantic relationships, people i can chat with and lasting friendships. something along those lines). that way someone like me who would choose lasting friendships wouldn\u2019t only get stuck with people looking for romantic relationships.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app is so poorly designed. For starters, when people are in the app in general watching lives it tells me that they aren\u2019t online but they really are.

The ages in the app are outrageous, kids under the age of 13 are in the app and it say it\u2019s for 17 when really the app allows it to have kids 13 and up but the age limit is 17+, MAKE UP YOUT MIND PEOPLE!! When people are reported for a thing they did wrong, they person whom reported them should get updates on the account and person too for say if they used foul language or showed inappropriate content and they were reported, they person who reported should get a text from Yubo saying there account has been taken down or he has been banned for 24 hours.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

It\u2019s like spoon feeding the pedophiles. Truthfully you need to watch some live streams to see what you\u2019re exposing children to. Your age guidelines make no sense either. You say 13 to register but it says 17+ for age when you\u2019re looking at the information from the App Store. This truly isn\u2019t an app children under the age of 18 should be on.

{"body":"At first before the new update I enjoyed the app. I was constantly meeting new people and getting swiped on. However in the new update there\u2019s an option to \u201cincrease your visibility\u201d by paying to become a member. After the new update released I was rarely getting matches. Now either this is a coincidence or they made it so that in order to be viewed by anyone you have to pay basically $9 a month (and must I remind you this is an app targeted for teenagers who probably only have their parents credit card on their phone) to have anybody swipe right on you. So now instead of it being the marketed \u201coptional enhancement\u201d it\u2019s basically now a necessity in order to have any actual success on this app. It also doesn\u2019t help that the update was completely mandatory. So now that you can\u2019t swipe to make friends you have to enter lives, and when I tell you that the lives have some of the most toxic environments that I\u2019ve ever been on, I mean it. While it\u2019s not the developers fault, teenagers will be jerks. The lives have 3 categories of awfulness. 1. Overly exploiting teenage sexuality. Many people feel that the only way to gain attention is through sexualizing themselves. While a lot of the times it\u2019s for clickbait there have genuinely been times where nudity has been featured. 2. Rating. Due to the demographic of this app being teenagers, and your success on this app being based off of how you look, practically everyone on this app is extremely insecure. And how do teenagers (especially immature ones) deal with their insecurities? Well they tell other people that they\u2019re ugly that\u2019s what. I was literally just on a live where with no prompting to the guy in here just said \u201ceven though you don\u2019t want me to, I\u2019m gonna rate you. You\u2019re a one\u201d. This was with no prompting because the environment on this app forces people to be quick to want to bring others up just because that\u2019s what makes them feel better about themselves. I\u2019ve built myself up to a point where I\u2019m happy with who I am and know that I\u2019m not ugly, however many people aren\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen perfectly attractive people being insulted with no provocation. And 3. People who just do horrible stuff to get attention. Due to this app being compromised of teenagers many feel that the only way to get views is to be \u201cedgy\u201d. This leads to all the most popular lives consisting of drug use, alcoholism, or my favorite: hate speech. That\u2019s right whenever there\u2019s a live that says \u201cbeing gay is wrong\u201d or \u201cwhites only\u201d or saying the N word but misspelling it, or saying \u201cno gays\u201d, it is guaranteed to be popular. Even if it\u2019s for clickbait there are times that I\u2019ve logged in to find people legitimately advocating for homophobic ideals, or seeing a white person use the N word. And with the average teenager\u2019s psychology, you can bet that this reaffirms their belief that these behaviors are okay. Also sometimes #1 and #3 are combined with such gems as \u201cwhite girls \ud83e\udd24\u201d or \u201cWhite girls only\u201d. And all this would be less of a problem if the swiping system wasn\u2019t so messed up and I could chose who I want to talk to. But since the only places where I can add new friends is through lives it\u2019s pretty difficult. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, there are some nice people who create lives that spread positivity, and I\u2019ve genuinely had some good conversations on this app. However those times are way outshined by the abundance of toxicity in this app\u2019s community.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

This used to be a really good app and it grew so much because of the fact that you didn\u2019t have to pay to meet people, but now the whole thing has gotten out of hand.

This app is so fun to use and just relax with because it\u2019s basically Omegle without the hassle. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I still love it. I met my current boyfriend on this app and now we\u2019re moving in together and we\u2019re really solid, but still. It\u2019s not only a dating app; meeting people and talking to them is still nice. It just feels like one of those games you have to pay to win, like Clash of Clans. It\u2019s really annoying because this app used to be just so much fun. It got ruined because the devs felt the need to jack up their development costs. And the \u201cpower ups\u201d are ridiculous. Stop it with this lol. Bring the old app back.

Also the filters don\u2019t really work - I\u2019ve tried to limit based on age as I\u2019m more interested in meeting friends in a similar age group, but I still end up with people way outside my age range. I\u2019ve also spent a few minutes swiping and then the app re-ran those same profiles by me again.

Then I looked at my \"Heys\" and I only had 46, so something is super buggy with the app. As well, I got a message from someone inviting me to go to an arts & crafts fair but it seemed like it was about a week late as the fair was the weekend before. Then I responded to the person and have received nothing back. Please fix the bugs!!!!!\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t like that I have to sign in after every update like it doesn\u2019t remember me.

To charge a cent for this weird female tinder knockoff is pushed by greed. The app should be free and if you want to charge why not charge for pro features or charge to plan a group meetup. To charge to see who wants to be friends is such a sham. As grown women we should not be falling for this like we are in middle school. Wake Up! I will be deleting this app, and all those I have sent an invite to try I will advise them to delete as well. This app is for the desperate!

I\u2019ve had vina for about a year now and haven\u2019t really had any \u201creal\u201d connections yet. But I will continue to use it & see what happens! \ud83d\ude0a","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"So the concept is there. Meet other gals and find pals. Cute layout and easy to navigate. The downfall is that in order to see your \u201cHeys\u201d you have to pay. I have a suspicion that they withhold the other Heys for you to Hey back and get a Ditto in the algorithm. The first review is \u201chey be patient...\u201d and there are others similarly written and can only guess those are fake reviews. I get that coding and company upkeep isn\u2019t cheap, but there are better apps that are completely free and just as effective for finding friends.\n\nGive the opportunity to naturally Hey back with all ladies or at least give ladies a completely free trial for the first week or first three days, based on emails. If that were the case, I would have paid $6 for one week to hey back new ladies. Even if it was just once a month. Otherwise, this is a ridiculous app that is focused on money grabbing, not the overall message of make lady friends. I will be using another app because this one is disappointing.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"It\u2019s such a brilliant idea but it\u2019s very confusing for what should be a very simple and fun app. One you have to pay to see your matches. Really? You\u2019re losing people because of that. \nAlso it\u2019s confusing because you cant access your hey without paying but at times you can access it via the alert section. I assume a bug. I think illl use it for one more week but it\u2019s really disappointing. Maybe someone will take this idea and make it free for its users. So many different ways you can make profit once you have a solid foundation.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

I just recently opened another account in the hopes that the app had improved and it has! But... I haven\u2019t gotten any matches. I now believe that it is the location where I\u2019m at (deserted town with nothing to do). I hope this app works well for other places. I like the new section of groups and events \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc. \nA suggestion for the creators of this app: can you guys do something about the numerous amount of unused accounts and fake account? I strictly filtered out girls below 23 yrs and still got many teens and early 20\u2019s.\nIn summary: I believe the app has potential. I am looking forward to finishing my PhD and moving out of this place. The name (Vina) is terrible.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"neutral"}

And there were TONS of profiles in my region which was surprising (NH & outside of Boston). I made it a policy to pass on anyone who didn\u2019t bother to say anything specific in their profile.

I am very happy to finally be meeting someone when we might have things in common, however  that being said I can\u2019t meet the people I\u2019ve connected with due to the fact I\u2019d have to pay for this app. On a personal note I work a part time job full time..  i don\u2019t make 500.00 a paycheck and I do live with my man and we have a pet meaning I don\u2019t have the extra money to put in an app to connect with one person when only 20 people if that are on this app in my area.. I believe if the app was free until the publicity came to it then possible charge with a free week trial like everything else were used to then the app would progress. I am keeping the app I just now have my mobile number advertised everywhere on my profile which will defeat the purpose of this app but it\u2019s the only cheap option I have.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"With all the negative reviews I wanted to test the app to see what is and isn\u2019t good. \n\nFirst, I prefer NOT to use social media to sign up for anything. My profiles are private for a reason and I sure don\u2019t want to use them for app signs ups. \n\nThis app ONLY allows sign up using Facebook or Instagram (which is now owned by Facebook). You can input your email but you\u2019ll receive a notice saying email sign up isn\u2019t available and you\u2019ll be notified when it is. \n\nThis should\u2019ve been an option already implemented, not still a work in progress. \n\nThat alone got a one star for me. I get 99.9% of people are glued to their ssm accounts but for that 1%, we aren\u2019t. Not everyone wants to use ssm to sign up for an account. \n\nAs far as pricing and the other areas, I can\u2019t comment. \n\nI won\u2019t waste my time with this app. I also agree with another reviewer that $6 a week is expensive, given the lack of a basic sign up. If it doesn\u2019t offer filters-that\u2019s another lack. \n\nEssentially, this app would cost $24 a month to use. That\u2019s a lot.\n\nThe dev even commented that it\u2019s the price of a latte. Good to know, but again...that\u2019s assuming everyone interested in the app drinks lattes. I don\u2019t, do you? I make tea at home. \n\nSome users commented on not having a free trial and the dev commented about finding a bestie and saying it\u2019s the best $6 ever spent, again, that\u2019s assuming a friend is found within a week. It takes more than that amount if time to become \u201cbesties\u201d. \n\nThe app maybe free is you choose not to upgrade but this app feels like a beta mode app\u2014the devs should\u2019ve beta tested this before releasing. \n\nI review a lot of apps and products. This one just isn\u2019t ready for public use. \n\n Just to be clear, my review is based on my use (or lack of thereof) and what I\u2019ve read from other reviewers, and the premise of the app.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

After downloading it last night I already matched with someone and we\u2019ve been chatting. I feel like this app is brilliant and has soo much potential. You can plan dates, it even GIVES you IDEAS for dates, horoscopes and cute quizzes to take. Mind you, the. App. Is. Free. It\u2019s also beautifully designed. Ive only dreamed of an app like this but never knew there was such a thing. One thing I will say is that it would be great if the app had more promotion like an add on Instagram, Facebook or even a commercial to get more people to use it.

Nobody else had the balls or strategies like they did to implement this app so before you go making negative comments remember you downloaded this app and have it because of them. ALSO, I\u2019ve met about 4 women from this app IN PERSON and none of them wanted me to be their \u201cgirlfriend\u201d.

I moved to a new town and all I want is to be able to meet new people and find friends as an adult without the daunting costs of ANOTHER subscription to do so.

{"body":"Really lame that they charge you a subscription for what looks like a one time fee to see who swiped on you. So basically they will continually charge you until you cancel your \u201csubscription\u201d that you never agreed to. Gross!","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"So there aren\u2019t that many people to meet on here. Every time I match with someone and message them I never get a reply so I\u2019m assuming either I\u2019m just an awful person apparently or no one ever checks their profile. I wish I could see people I swiped left on but said hey to me but in order to do that you have to PAY for that privilege which I think is stupid. I\u2019m a stay at home mom and I was really hoping this app would help me connect with other women and help me get out but I\u2019ve only met one person. Good concept but no one ever uses it and I don\u2019t want to pay 5.99 for a week or being able to see my \u201chey\u2019s\u201d.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I liked the concept at first but it\u2019s almost impossible to match with any possible friends because it doesn\u2019t seem like people are too active. It would be a little better if you could actually send someone a message but you can\u2019t until you\u2019ve matched with someone.. which doesn\u2019t happen too often because most of the profiles are old.

I think this app was already struggling and I am extremely disappointed because it is already so difficult to find female friends as is. I think when it comes to friendship, it\u2019s a little insane to have to pay and since I have a lot on my plate financially, I won\u2019t be upgrading to the new version.

Other than that and some bugs that need to be worked on I like it overall but I probably won\u2019t be on it too much if I\u2019m unable to \u201cmatch\u201d my hey\u2019s. This problem is making it hard to actually make friends, which is the entire point of the app right?","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Maybe the reason there aren\u2019t that many people because there are a look of gals like me that don\u2019t have Facebook. I have Instagram; why can\u2019t you confirm that I am a real person using that or in various other ways that other apps do?

I\u2019ve matched with almost everyone and still cannot see who swiped right on my profile, which is a bit frustrating. My advice to the developer, if someone swipes right on another members profile, they should immediately move to the top of our swipe list and have the option to message us. I\u2019ve been on this app almost a week and have yet to talk to anyone. It\u2019s a waste of time! 1\/5.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"In theory this is a great app. It is well put together and that\u2019s about it. The girls on this app are the same girls that complain about wanting friendship but then blow off every effort anyone ever attempts to make with them. It\u2019s so oversaturated with these females that the ones that actually are trying to broaden their social circle is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. So not different than real life and only serves as another digital way of blowing people off. Waste of time... and it\u2019s a shame because the developers have a great app here... but at the end of the day, people will be people.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I agree with the first review. It seems like these profiles are old and not being currently used so it\u2019s kind of a waste of time.

Also, if u make a match some never respond, so I\u2019m guessing those profiles are old? If someone does talk to you they do it for a second and then they ask you to add them to Instagram because they are \u201cbloggers\u201d and need followers!\nAlso I run out of people to swipe lol. Most of other girls in there don\u2019t share my interest, so maybe the app needs more marketing?\nI\u2019ve only meet one nice girl and we went for lunch.. we talk here and there because she\u2019s busy with the boyfriend?

Then this morning my bf was looking for me on Facebook, he found me but he couldn\u2019t get on my profile from anywhere. He told me about it.

{"body":"Love the style, concept, personality quizzes, all that, but it doesn\u2019t matter if you never match with anyone, no matter how many \u201cheys\u201d you receive. Similar apps have it to where, if someone likes you they show up in your more recent options, but not this one. If you live in a dense user-area, you can swipe forever and rarely match, even with all the \u201cHeys\u201d. It\u2019s discouraging.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Heard about this app and thought I'd give it a try so I could meet some groovy new girlfriends. What a disappointment. \n\nFirst, you must have a Facebook account, supposedly to prove you're actually female. (Because nobody ever fakes anything on FB and we all need companies like Cambridge Analytica to have more of our data...) \n\nThe FB validation interface gave me the option to exclude my friend list, birthday, email, etc. so I did. Only then the app doesn't load the next step or allow you to click on login. So I had to go back, uninstall the app, reinstall the app, start again and try to guess which pieces of data could be excluded. Why don't you list this upfront? And no, you can't have my friend list. \n\nWhich leads to my #2 complaint. When you finally get the app to load and start entering your interests, it asks for your contacts from your address book. First you want my FB friend list and then you want my contacts? No. Yes, this step can be skipped, but don't ask for it in the first place because girlfriends don't give out their friends' info without permission.\n\nI never got to the matching step because apparently I unchecked sharing my email address in the Facebook validation process. Hey Vina was supposed to send me a confirmation email but ten minutes later it still hadn't arrived in my mail or spam box. \n\nApp deleted.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Really? With all of the terrible press that Facebook has been involved with in the past few years, not to mention it\u2019s privacy invasions and selling of personal information I find it ridiculous that so many apps still require it to \u201cverify\u201d gender - as if fb is the end-all be-all.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"We all know that making friends as an adult - or at any age for that matter - is not easy and this is a great opportunity to meet people who you could not possibly meet any other way, and that\u2019s the great thing about this platform, but I have noticed how some profiles either the women who wrote them have like zero imagination or are simply fake, because the description is the exact same one about coffee and wine, and much more, even with the same exact space after each emoji  - and you can\u2019t copy and paste text from the app so it has to be fake. Skeptical, but not deleting as I did chat with some pretty nice gals, who are real! A lot to fix product wise.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"positive"}

I am new in town and don\u2019t know many people other than my husband\u2019s coworkers. \nThere seem to be a few cool profiles on this app, but they are hidden in the hundreds of empty ones, and you have to keep swiping forever to get a \u201cmatch\u201d. \nFake\/empty\/inactive profiles are abundant and obvious. They come with one of three generic descriptions. If you swipe long enough, you\u2019ll start recognizing them immediately. One has a line about meeting \u201cover a cup of something warm\u201d. The other one says something like \u201cI still need to add some personal flair to my profile\u201d.

{"body":"... it keeps wiping my preferences and bio\/profile (even after today's update). Because of this I can only assume it wiped other users' bios... this is an issue to me because I skipped everyone at first who didn't have personalized info. Now I'm realizing their bios could have been wiped too and I have 3 \"heys\" that I apparently didn't swipe on so I'll never know if we would have been potential BFFs! \ud83d\ude2d it would be great if it was mandatory to fill out your bio before you show up in someone else's deck... it's not tinder, so I'm not gonna swipe right just because someone has a nice photo. I need the deets!\n\nAlso, PLEASE add an undo feature or a way to review profiles you've skipped. I accidentally skipped some people and now they're lost in the Vina Void forever. I am incredidesperate for friends in my new city. I need this guys.\n\nLastly, there are some typos in the questions you have to answer at the beginning, and misinformation which makes the app feel slightly unprofessional. For example, on the FAQ page, one section mentions the app is only for iOS at this time, but then a couple sections below that mentions that the app is available for Android. As a UX\/UI designer the inconsistency is a little annoying.\n\nDespite the possible missed connections, I do think this is a great idea and I have seen some people that I think could be great friends if we get to talking (no matches just yet!). I hope these things are fixed in the future because with everyone moving around and long distance moves becoming more common to chase job opportunities, we need apps like this!","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

The user base is also pretty small and I haven\u2019t had new Vinas to view for like 4 months. I wish there was a feed or something where you could post statuses\/pictures and find people that way too, not just a guessing and waiting game to see if you ever get matched.

Right?) a Vina, you\u2019ll never see them again unless they update their profile. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t catch onto that until I swiped through TONS of (probably) nice ladies to befriend. From what I can tell many women don\u2019t update their profile regularly (because why would you?) so you\u2019ll be waiting a looong time to match to another Vina.

I made my profile and within 2 minutes of finishing there was nothing I could do on it. It's impossible to have been reported because it was never even had the opportunity to be active as a profile. I think that's ridiculous and I genuinely don't buy it. I want nothing to do with your app and whatever discriminatory policy or loose flagging filters you have set in place.

It should be up to us once we see the \u201chey\u201d to make the connection or not. Otherwise this app has great potential!","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

They\u2019ve gotta market it more. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019ve had the app for two days now, zero matches and my deck is empty. I\u2019ve done all the quizzes, answered every question, and put in a bio. I\u2019ve got 5 Hey\u2019s, but seeing as my deck is empty, I\u2019ll never find out who they are. I wish I could see who. \n\nI\u2019ve been changing around my preferences, adding distance, bigger age gap, etc. But it hasn\u2019t helped much.

I\u2019m 22, I don\u2019t want to make friends with people in high school, and I don\u2019t want friends who are moms.

{"body":"I think it\u2019s a bit of both. There clearly aren\u2019t many women using hey vina in Philly bc the app keeps running out of vinas for my deck. The app itself is really glitchy and it took several times for my profile to actually save. This probably explains why so many women have generic profiles. My only rule is that I won\u2019t send a \u201chey\u201d to someone who hasn\u2019t bothered to update their profile (or perhaps they have but the app didn\u2019t save it - but how am I suppose to know that?). So this has really limited the potential friend pool. I also keep getting college kids in my deck despite the age filter, which makes me wonder what is the point of the filter? Finally, I also suspect that there are a lot of people who still have profiles up but who are no longer using the app (you can tell bc it seems that previously, the app created a generic profile for you that sounds like you\u2019ve written in but it\u2019s just based on what you selected for your profile quiz. Meaning, they\u2019ve been on the app for a while). I don\u2019t know if the developers send messages to people or deactivate after a bit but I suspect they don\u2019t. Wish they would. I have 17 \u201cheys\u201d after a week but only one match and I have no more vinas in my deck so I\u2019ll probably never get connected to any of the remaining 16.

Do you really think women who work and have lives have time to wait for someone to swipe yes on them or spend hours, days,weeks, or months trying to find a match?  The answer is no. A simple solution would be to see who heys you so that once someone heys you, you can see it and then have the option to hey them back and message\/ get a conversation started!  Please make the messaging feature more accessible so that people can actually have a chance at making friends. This app is more like an aggravating life long teaser that is more of a headache than helpful. Also another major complaint is that after my 22 heys- they all disappeared for no apparent reason. \nWhy are my heys gone??? App developer can you give me an explanation? \n\nWhat the heck is this?

Funny!\n\nSecond, when you talk about verifying \u201cgender,\u201d you are talking about gender expression. Because sex and gender are two different things. Sex is biological and gender is social and culturally dictated. I understand trans people want the lines between the two blurred because it serves their legal purpose, with complete disregard to others and why there has always been a difference between the two. But as a biologist who studies human sex development, I can assure you that gender is not biological. I still get confused when people use gender to refer to sex. So, are you talking about people born biologically females or have become females through surgeries, or are you talking about the way one presents oneself (dresses and acts)?","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"So I am recently new to this app and seriously love the idea of being able to meet new gal pals... but the problem is when someone gives you a Hey!

Might delete because this is impossible","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I will admit that I absolutely love the concept in theory (a place to meet FRIENDS, not necessarily romantic partners) but:\n\n1. It is 2017, are we not progressive enough now to recognize that this service excludes those who are transgender and\/or gender non-binary?  This is no better than the anti-trans \u201cbathroom bills\u201d and the false fear of hetero cisgender men pretending to be women so they can go in the women\u2019s bathroom just to spy on them. I am a cisgender woman but that doesn\u2019t mean I am okay using a service that caters to \u201cwomen\u201d as defined by heteronormativity. FIND A SOLUTION.\n\n2. Why is this limited to Facebook users? I get \u201cverification\u201d insomuch as to weed out disingenuous heterosexual cisgender men who might want to abuse this service for their own gain, but surely there are other methods for ensuring that users aren\u2019t here to abuse the service for finding something other than friendship. I don\u2019t use Facebook (haven\u2019t used it in years) and I don\u2019t want to be forced to use it. \n\n3. As a potential alternative to Facebook for verification, here\u2019s something this company SHOULD NOT DO: ask people to provide documentation that proves their \u201clegal\u201d gender status. This is still problematic because not all people identify with their \u201clegal\u201d gender. So heads up, this would not at all be the appropriate alternative solution to the Facebook issue.\n\n4. A possible solution to at least avoiding trolls or people creating numerous fake accounts: consider what the website Metafilter does. You are permitted to one account, which is linked to your PayPal account (which you use to pay the one time $5 fee for joining). It maintains accountability as far as being able to confirm the person and prevent them from creating multiple Catfish accounts or just making a new account if they get banned for abusive behavior (and what constitutes abusive behavior needs to be carefully and respectfully considered).\n\n5. Outside of the above, we need to respect a person\u2019s preferred gender identity. If someone is clearly a straight cisgender dude looking for a way to sexually harass and \u201cpick up\u201d folks online, let other folks flag them. There should then be a panel of (perhaps volunteer, community member?) transgender\/non binary\/intersex\/gender fluid users who can review to determine if the flagged user is, in fact, abusing the purpose of the app or has instead just been falsely\/maliciously flagged. \n\nNo system is perfect, but the one above might be a good start to creating a better system that is friendly to people other than cisgender women.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"It\u2019s such a cute app and great idea, but 8\/10 of the profiles on there are bots. The bios are basically the same for every profile, so I feel uncomfortable linking with a bot.

{"body":"I\u2019ve been on this app less than 24 hours and I\u2019m getting kind of frustrated. First of all, why do so many of the profiles have the same exact bio? I mean, verbatim! Fake profiles? Perhaps. Also, if someone sends you a HEY! you should be able to see them and start a conversation. I\u2019ve swiped right on nearly everyone and have yet to find who did the same for me. The age preference doesn\u2019t seem to work. I\u2019m 31 - I\u2019m not interested in hanging out with a high schooler or even a college freshman. Lastly, if I swipe right on someone I shouldn\u2019t see them in my deck again. That makes no sense. \n\nThis has the ability to be a great app but a few things ruin the experience. Hopefully it gets better.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app would be so much better if you had the option to see who swiped right on your pic. What a waste of time to not be able to see! Even if they added a feature where you can pay additional it would save so much time. This should not be a game of mystery. The initial idea and concept of adding quizzes is nice but not being able to see who liked your page makes the app horrible","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Like the title says, the app\u2019s idea is very useful.\n\nUnfortunately, the app notifies you about inane things on a daily basis. For example, the app notified me that it\u2019s 11:11 and notified me about \u201cFriendship Facts\u201d. \n\nNotifications are also used to inform the user about new matches and messages, which are the point of the app so I haven\u2019t turned them off notifications entirely through iOS\u2019s settings. \n\nDevs, please add a setting to turn off these verbose and useless messages. I won\u2019t open your app more often just because you tell me the time or \u201cFriendship Facts\u201d.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Overall, it's a good app. \n\nPros: There is a solid user base that seems to be growing. The quizzes and content are good and would be a cool addition in our similar apps.\n\nCons: The messaging is a bit juvenile at times and the app has a couple bugs that I'm hoping they will fix.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I hope that in the future, your team will change your policy to allow users who don't recognize themselves in a binary definition of gender. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I definitely enjoy the fact that there are no cis men on Vina. A man-free environment is an environment free from the ordinary stresses of navigating the traditional gendered power dynamic, and free from the worry that a potential friend might want to trick or harm you. I don't think these advantages will be lost if you gain users who identify with your very feminine branding but don't feel like the label of \"woman\" completely represents them. I actually think that these benefits are IMPROVED by including gender non-conforming folks. As long as a user is not a man, I think they should enjoy and contribute to Vina's man-free space. If old, staid institutions like Barnard and Wellesley can expand their definitions of what it means to be a woman, then Vina definitely should be more inclusive.","category":"Social Networking","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This is a super cool idea for an app and I\u2019ve met up with a few fun ladies I just wish the messaging wasn\u2019t so glitchy.

I assumed that it would just be there but nope, it was back to the default bio. Super annoying. I\u2019ll keep it for now and hope that it gets better. *Update* So after I wrote my initial review I went back to the app and did everything over.

And I won't let you message them unless you \"match\". While swiping right I saw so many people with similar interests who would've like to get to know, but it won't let you message them either. I understand that they want to limit unwanted contact, and match similar people, but all it's doing is limiting the users ability to choose who they communicate with, and hindering the potential to find a new a bff.

Being in Austin, 90% of the women are under 25 and it is painful to swipe through them all. Second, I see other moms my age that would be a great match - I wish I could just send a message.

Other than this I like it.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I have the older app but bought this one since the old one didn\u2019t carry Glenn Beck anymore. This app shows Beck and Laura Ingram are both broadcasting but neither are. Beck program is local Dallas radio and Laura Ingram is actually Brian Kilmede.  Total ripoff","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"App does not recognize when you\u2019ve travelled \u2018beyond the range\u2019 of your wireless home network. Rather than recognizing that there is no signal and transitioning to cell service, it keeps trying to reconnect to a service that\u2019s no longer available. You either have to switch to an alternate host and then go back or (if none are available) reboot the app. The Pandora app recovers gracefully in this scenario; this app is not fault tolerant. Repeated emails to developer go unanswered.  The developer either doesn\u2019t know what regression testing means or doesn\u2019t maintain the app.  An addendum: it\u2019s now also frequently dropping the Hannity show, and reconnecting by going to other shows and back again no longer solves the problem. Again, not a very fault tolerant app. I have a very fast internet connection, and this does not happen with other apps. Unfortunately, this app rarely fixes bugs like this.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I absolutely love this ap!  It offers a list of fantastic personalities shows on demand so we could go back and listen to shows in the past at anytime as well as the most up to date show at that moment!  What is also fantastic about this ap is that it also gives us the ability to hear different A.M. stations all over the country from West thru East coast so I can hear conservatives from other areas of the country that don\u2019t have a nationally aired show!  Because of this I have found a few new conservative personalities that I didn\u2019t know anything about that I love!  In other words the ap gives you the ability to discover the Glenn Becks or Mark Levins that haven\u2019t become a national star yet!  It is like discovering those underground musicians that later become huge!  Any conservative out there would love this ap!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The app has archived podcasts of various shows but the Mark Levin podcast on this app stopped updating in October 2017. I emailed the app developer about this and have been ignored.

Recently, I stopped receiving Mark Levin\u2019s podcast and a couple of weeks later Alex Jones\u2019s podcast history disappeared, blank page, nothing.  I\u2019ve only owned this app for a couple of months and the podcasts were the main reason I made the purchase. Very disappointed. No stars should be an option.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

If you want to stay informed it\u2019s the perfect way to do that. They offer a lot (daily read, the daily skimm, podcasts, colander of events, etc...) and the best part is that if you can\u2019t afford to pay for it you can just sign up for the emails which I did for a few months and it was good, of course the app is better though. Also, with the app you can now sign up for text questions so they send you a topic each week and you can ask questions and they will answer them. I just signed up for it and can\u2019t wait to ask about the next topic.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

It makes it so I can at least have an idea of what\u2019s going on and maybe talk intelligently about it.

{"body":"Hello, I just downloaded this app the other day and I have to say I\u2019m really loving it. I\u2019m a 27 year old stay at home mom and I can\u2019t always have the news on or sit on my phone and read up on world affairs\/daily news. This is one of the best apps I\u2019ve ever come across. It covers everything and I love that it explains what certain things are like the (Nuclear deal) for example. That is my favorite part of the app. Since I tend to be out of the loop, I sometimes don\u2019t know what things are about. I\u2019m normally a Twitter user but this app goes far beyond because it takes the time to cover everything, stick with key points and explain what things are. I\u2019m finding myself clicking on this app more so than Twitter now! I have no issues paying for this service whatsoever. Thank you to the creators of this app. I can tell a lot of love went into it and hard work on the daily. 5 stars from me!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

Because this app reads like a book report on a newspaper. Few topics, and nothing in depth.

It's not yet there.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"When I first looked at this app I wasn\u2019t into the subscription fee idea. But the more I used it the more I loved it. I barely have time to read the regular news so I get most of my information from Twitter which is... frankly awful. With Skimm I get a nonpartisan view on the matter, stating all sides that there could be to a story and even better, WHY it\u2019s important with mini podcasts, interviews and more details when it counts. I can listen to the 10 minute podcasts in the treadmill, or just on my way to the grocery store. And there\u2019s lots of sources from all across the internet. So I never have to wonder where the data comes from. \nNeedless to say I fully embrace the subscription as, for me, it is worth the money to save the time to get the facts. With all the \u201cfake news\u201d floating around, I needed a source that I can trust but knew that just 1 place wouldn\u2019t give me that, not if I want all the facts from everywhere. But Skimm does that! I love feeling informed and being in the loop of things. So, thank you Skimm, and you can bet that I\u2019ll be around for a while and telling all of my friends to check you out. \nP.S. those mini podcasts really are awesome. They give you the history of a topic that may be really prevalent in the news right now but requires some previous knowledge. So if after reading the daily news you are left wondering what all the fuss is about, Skimm can fill you in.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

I'd probably pay a one time fee to download this app. But I won't pay monthly to use a calendar (though I do love the idea of having political events and such synced to my calendar for me), listen to news podcasts that I can listen to for free else where, or to have someone recommend what I should read and watch (again, love the idea and wouldn't mind suggestions at all, but my friends do that for free).

It\u2019s an app for 14 year olds who want to hear the latest world drama and maybe a snippet or two about relevant and significant world politics and news. I think the wording of the articles is supposed to come off casual, but really it just sounds immature.

Moreover, the person who gives and explains information about various political and social topics in the \u2018podcast-part?\u2019 of the app is intolerable; it\u2019s less informational and more like listening to someone judge, muddle up facts, and even throw shade.

Soo the Skimm adds info about the liberal \u201cWomen\u2019s March\u201d (which is really just an Anti-Trump Protest Ralley) but does not mention the YEARLY \u201cMARCH FOR LIFE\u201d [a yearly PRO-LIFE MARCH since 1974!!!].. even though President Donald Trump is speaking at this Pro-Life March... Sooo sad!! \n\n[MAINSTREAM MEDIA COVERAGE: The 2017 Liberal \u201cWomen's March\u201d received 75 minutes of news coverage between the mainstream Networks while the \u201cMarch for Life\u201d received just 35 seconds.]\n______________\n\nGOOD THINGS about the SKIMM:\n\nLove how all the NEWS-Dates are transferred onto your iPhone Calendar automatically if you want.

The minute this becomes just another LIBERAL news-source (ie like much of our U.S. Mainstream Media) is the minute I delete the Skimm.. but yeah it\u2019s center LEFT for sure.. but not crazy left. \n\nAfter you use-up the Free Month Trial you have a choice to either pay $2.99 a month or $29 a year.. by default it goes to the $2.99 a month fee-- but you can change it to $29 a year in your Skimm settings.. they don't tell you that upfront.. a bit ambiguous.. which sadly might turn potential Skimm customers off that don't like and\/or don't do monthly subscription payments. They should let people know in advance on the App Info of the two choices. :)","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I was very excited about the features of this application. The weekly podcasts are a great feature. However, their most recent one on our president, was enough to make me unsubscribe. I really thought their regular news was pretty fair and non opinionated, but this podcast on Trump was simply wrong. He is our president and alll The Skimm Did was bash him. They did not focus on one of the good things that he has done for our country. It is clear what side The Skimm is on and are promoting their liberal views to their listeners. Even if they are not Trump supporters, he is still our President. I was a huge advocate for this application and company, supporting their business, but I just can\u2019t support a company who people trust for their news daily when they are so one sided.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

I just have two issues: the first is that the ratio of entertainment\/fun-content to real-news-content favors the former a little too much. The second is that there\u2019s a subscription fee. No matter how much value people get from an app, a large subset of the population will always turn down an app that charges money.

They\u2019re fun but I couldn\u2019t decide if they were worth 3 dollars. Then I started to think about it as if the emails weren\u2019t free. Each daily skimm would cost about 10 cents with the subscription, then with everything else thrown in as well I definitely think that\u2019s worth it! It\u2019s hard paying for something you can get for free, but this service has become something I depend on.

Failing to respect my cancellation before end of trial, this app levied unwanted subscription charges for months after I\u2019d cancelled and racked up repeated consequences for me from hitting accounts near their limit. Refunds may be promised but there\u2019s been an utter failure to deliver.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Got this app for the audio news summaries. The narrator sounded like a buzzfeed article.

{"body":"Though I have just downloaded the App, I love it so far! I just read another review protesting the slight fee, the argument being that the content is already out there. This is true, but it takes the brilliant team at the Skimm time and effort to put it together in the various formats, including the calendars. \nI find that the people behind this App have done a tremendous job to make it light and funny!  The news is the news, they do not change that, but the way they present some things are great (IMHO).  A good sense of humor in today\u2019s crazy and infuriating world is worth the minuscule price all by itself!!!  \nI highly recommend this App, and I am a news junkie. Bravo, Skimm Team. You have me smiling!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I respect the idea behind this. One stop shop for news snippets and such. However, I must rate this low for one reason. A subscription fee. No matter how low, what reason should anyone pay for this? I\u2019m not saying this because the content is poor, or it\u2019s a bad app. I say this because all this information is already out there. The idea of short news podcasts has been done to death. No matter your politics, all the major news networks in the U.S., and beyond, already put out 10-15 minute news digests, FOR FREE. If this app had no subscription fee, it would likely be excellent. However, for some reason, the creators of this app feel they need to charge you for information already provided for free. Information that you most likely already know. Football fan? You knew when the games are. Political junkie? You keep up with all the political news already. I just don\u2019t see the reason to pay money monthly to have spam alerts put in my calendar, get news digests, and really that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t see the need for anyone to pay for information already readily available. Skimm, your app seems great, and I\u2019d love to use it. However, I don\u2019t forsee a long future for this. If you switched to a free with ads model, I think there would be a greater future for y\u2019all. But a subscription fee to get what\u2019s so readily available from so many sources? What reason should I have to pay for already free information?","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

I know what new series seasons are starting, when awards shows are broadcasting, and I can even tell my husband what time and station the \"big game\" is coming on.

From where I sit, it is a bit too cute and a bit too loc (left of center) in its views and articles. Personally, I would like a subscription that was more - straight down the middle. No cutsie, No commentary. Just the facts. News, not Editorial. Reporting, not Commentary. IMHO, the American public is hungry for honest news, not bias. Life is about balance, and balance is usually found in the middle - a place our journalists fear to tread. How about an app subscription called - \"Bullseye - no bull, just an honest look!\"","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The Skimm is aiming to be your personal assistant with witty morning briefs. You can adjust the content according to your interests and make it more personal. However, I'm pretty sure it doesn't learn more about you like Pandora's like\/dislike algorithm. As a result after a couple of days it starts to fall short of keeping your interest up. Like, I opted for politics and I've been getting all kinds of updates on DACA every day, but no news about world politics. App could easily ask me more questions for getting the content really personalized. Also, there seems to be a problem with the timings since there're recommendations for a long weekend after the long weekend or it redirects me to AppStore to download the app although I already have it. One thing that I like abot the Skimm is that you can add news to your calendar and see the important events on a timeline. \n\ntl dr; content is too generic and no effort to personalize it.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

What a bunch of grumps in the reviews!! There's absolutely nothing wrong with the company asking for $2.99 after a free month trial. The emails are free and while they don't offer as much as the app, they're a perfectly fine resource. It baffles me that people spend their time writing a review about not wanting to pay a few dollars a month to support an awesome company.

I am a high school English teacher who specializes in expository reading and writing \u2013 analyzing nonfiction and news articles; therefore, I feel even more embarrassed that I don't know what's going on. \n\nThe Skimm has been a godsend to me! I now feel informed and able to talk to my friends about what's going on in the WHOLE world instead of in simply my own. The best part is that I can read up on the news before my baby's attention span dwindles. I love the way the authors write. I even laugh out loud at times. Their wit and cynicism is extremely entertaining. \n\nThanks, Skimm!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

It let me get done with setup but never past the login screen. I get an error when logging in every time. Even after delete\/re-install. There was no prompt about the subscription either. Not happy with this app at all. I tried it awhile ago and found it to be too excessive, too many alerts for example. I liked some features but I didn't like how full my calendar suddenly looked it all the emails and notifications.

But I have noticed it's gotten slightly more gender-neutral. \n\nAwesome concept here and happy to see it evolving for the better. I mainly use it for the Skimm Ahead calendars. And am happy to keep paying to get that feature. \n\nMaybe as the company grows, they can have a Skimm geared for the other 50% of the market-- guys.

Secondly, their story compelled me; I wanted to contribute to their success. \n\nTo those that are complaining that it costs money to read this news source, it's really only $2.99... you pay more for your cable bill and listen to partisan news. News sources charge $ because newspapers are dead (what's a newspaper...?). Also, this is much better for the environment. Happy to pay $2.99 to save some trees. \n\nThis team knows how to pull important info from an event and put it into cliff notes for you to ingest quickly. They know how to talk to millennials that are like \"what's a government shutdown...?\" and make the explanation clear and concise while also being nonpartisan. \n\nI think this is an excellent app that I'll be using for a long time. Love. It.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

I very much enjoy the newsletter and will continue to get that but I know you don't need to charge people for this app since you have advertisers...!

{"body":"We all like skimming through sites on our phone and the app is good at organizing it but it costs money and I see other hidden costs as you venture to other sites. It would be more transparent and appropriate to charge $2.99 up front without incurring future costs.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"The Skimm is quick, informative, witty news. I love the Skimm app because of the Skimm Ahead feature which lets you know what is coming up in the near future (say, a country's election or the solar eclipse) so you know what to expect. Simple, clean cut, organized, and just the right amount of information.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Do not use The Skimm in an attempt to have an intelligent, informed conversation about world events. The writing is sophomoric. The only difference between The Skimm & The Weekly Reader they use to hand out in elementary school, The Skimm hints at vulgar language. Coarse language does not make one \"edgy\". It is a sign of a weak mind trying to express itself forcefully. \n\nI am not surprised celebrities endorse this product. It seems like something that would appeal to court jesters.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I love starting off the day with theSkimm. It's a quick skim over the major events, even sports which I'm not a fan of so I skim over that ish. Great topics for finance and sometimes trading. Humorous. I'm very picky about biased or politically skewed articles. TheSkimm passes the test as a trustworthy source. To top it off they make great wine suggestions on occasion. My clients always love these classy selections as a thanks for their business.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Received a notification that there was an issue with my Apple ID. Something about a purchase not being resolved. Did some research and found out that this app hit me for $2.99\n\nI'd never even downloaded the app. It wasn't on any of my Apple devices but showed as a cloud purchase. No idea how or when as I'm the only one that manages my account. \n\nHad to contact Apple support. I'd avoid.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I read the previous reviews and am not sure what they are even talking about. It is just simply a snap shot of what is happening or has happened for the day. The Bias is what you bring to the table. It is true that you do have to agree to the trial and that the service is not free. If you do not like it simply cancel your subscription. It really isn't that hard to do! I am not sure if I will end up keeping this app. I have enjoyed what I have seen so far. It gives you a quick run down about subjects that people will be talking about and maybe somethings that people will not be which will make for a good did you know? The condense review is done in a clever and interesting way. That style may not be for everyone! The reason why I am not sure if I will keep it or not is I am not sure that for the amount of stories they provide that it is worth the price tag! I will keep it for the first month and then determine if it is enough news (stories) to justify the cost!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"At first I thought this app was cute. A few days into it, I realized this is more like opinions of the news. Too bad. A cute idea, but your bias is showing Skimm.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"You have to sign up for a subscription to even see how the app works. You do get a free month, but I'm not subscribing to something sight unseen and then going through the hoops to get out of it. If your app is good, people will subscribe, but the way it's designed it's like a bad gym membership.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I'm not someone who very easily understands what's going on around me, sad I know. Skimm is the perfect app! It updates me daily on EVERYTHING I need to know, and explains it in a super easy to understand way. It's worth every penny to be well informed :)","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I was excited to download this app because I get the skimm emails which are great. I saw that it had some in app purchases but what I didn't realize until I downloaded it is that the only option to access the app is allow them to sign me up for a 30 day trial which I'll get charged for after the 30 days-- $2.99 a month. That might not seem like a lot to others but I don't want to pay a monthly fee to simply access news. I'll just stick with the emails. Deleted the app.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"First of all, this app isn't free which the advertising made it seem to be, you'll  need a subscription. (1 month free)\nMy other issue is that it isn't moderate or central at all. All of the articles are very left winged and bias without a healthy balance of right winged news. Which in that case it should just stay moderate.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I have been rooting for the skimm for years! Just update the app cover! The graphics inside the app are great but the app button isn't.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"When I read the advertisement it sounded like a great idea. It also said some is free and some is paid but all is awesome. This is not true. After jumping through several hoops to install the app, you find out that you have to pay a monthly subscription for any of it to work. This is false advertising in this company should not be patronized. Get your news from somewhere else and boycott companies like this who take advantage of people and lie to them.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"If you are racist or you're a liberal you'll love this app! They really bias against white people and anything an republican has ever done. I liked it at the beginning but it's really spun out of control. Happy to have unsubscribed!","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Do not bother with this app if you are religious or right of center. Very biased and false \"info\" on pro-life issues. You can look at how the cover Donald Trump for example. They yap a lot about the protests, etc (as if that was the most important part of the day) and not much about anything else. Lots of links and promotion of The NY Times. Used to get the email but stopped because I could not stand the liberal slant. I give it two stars because I liked the book recs and have gotten some great reads. They need to look into getting some conservatives on their staff for diverse news coverage. Can't see paying for liberal news coverage when they are anti-Trump and pro-abortion. I can get that for free from the main stream media every day.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I am so grateful for the Skimm! As a young individual who wants to keep up with current events, it's so refreshing to find a source that continually stays unbiased and keeps up with the facts. There is so much commentary, and noise being portrayed as \"news\" these days, The Skimm has counteracted this with their small snippets but factual journalism on what's going on in the world. If you want commentary, or more details just clink on the link! I read it every morning before work, or class. When I found out they finally got an app, I immediately downloaded it. LOVE YOU SKIMM!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"When running this app for the first time, you have to run a gauntlet of offers. Once you've fought your way to the front door, you learn that your efforts have been rewarded with 30 days usage of all the features of this app, after which it's gonna cost you. I can get all the news I want for free, from thousands of sources. Not going to pay for it.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"App has no functionality unless you agree to a 2.99\/month subscription right up front.  I'd be happy to pay for something AFTER I get to use it.  The argument is I can always cancel, but who remembers that??","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"It won't sync with the calendars no matter what. Basically just pops out a message it is an error then ask you to change the setting even you have already did the setting .","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Where has this been all my life? A little bit of everything. Links to go more in depth in each category, if you so choose. No pop-ups, no irrelevant ads adding clutter to the visual field. A little pop culture, politics, only the big sports goings on, new on TV, New in literature, wine suggestion, humorous (I'm sure I missed a sub category or 2) all written in a clear concise format. Brevity without sacrifice! BRILLIANT AND RELEVANT!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Almost every 4\/5 star review is from April 19-20, 2016.  That is, the reviews that this one app will change your life are fake.  This isn't that great, they just want you to download and sign up for free so they can skim $3 from your bank account each month when you forget to cancel the subscription you automatically sign up for when you activate the 30 days free. ($3 a month from 100,000 people is $3.6 mil a year, so it only takes a relatively small number of iPhone users not paying attention to make a lot of money).  Do yourself a favor and pass on this.  It's not worth it.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Great news - excellent writing - just the right amount of information without being overloaded like other news sites. The mix of serious news and humorous presentation is a relief from the overly serious and doomsday traditional media sites.

{"body":"I was intrigued at the app, it is an original thought and a fun execution, but after peeling back the layers my suspicions were confirmed. \n\nNot quite a flat out anti-conservative spin, but most articles are defending Hillary, Obama, and the whole racist BLM movement. \n\nAND, you want me to agree to a subscription. \n\nThat \"poof\" you hear is the sound of me deleting your app and wondering when you Gawker-wannabes will learn.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I felt like it's more theSkamm rather than theSkimm.  The app allows a free download but the only content is a requirement to subscribe at $2.99\/month.  The service might be fine but it begins dishonest to get it on your phone.  Boo.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I open it up. First article I see is about the NC bathroom bill. Repeats the same progressive talking point about the bill determining who can go into all public bathrooms. The truth is that it covers state owned bathrooms and preempts localities from saying anything about privately owned public bathrooms. \nThis is another progressive rag trying to pass itself off as non partisan.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

I'm not sure how or why it chooses to provide you with topics or articles.\nAnd it's not really news, but all this isn't really a problem if you like the content. Here are my issues: \n\nIt makes you subscribe for $3.00 a month (but first 30 days free!\ud83d\ude12)\n\nAnd, do NOT let it mess with your calendar.

{"body":"When I first subscribed to theSkimm, it was a game changer. \nA few changes in morning routine have made a great difference in my general knowledge and opinion on important issues. \n \nI am well informed after a short email or application cruise. Not only am I now more knowledgeable than yesterday but I almost always get a laugh in before breakfast. Can you say the same? \nHalt. I'm not done yet. \nYou can win stuff daily! It can't really get better than that on a workday before eight AM, guys.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

The app has a lot of great features, including TheSkimm book recommendations (my personal favorite) and important calendar dates to remember. 5 stars!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Not impressed with this app or the Skimm at all in general. This is a very biased news group. They are prejudice and in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another. You might start out liking it and then realize how much fluff your reading like the tabloids. \n.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Summaries should tell me what's in the story, so I can decided if I want to read.  Trying to hard to be cute & wasting my time & reading space so I have no idea what the article is about.

{"body":"The ONLY qualm I have with you is that everyone once in a blue moon, you sprinkle in some biased comments that lean to the left. But for the most part, you guys give me the news and you present it in a very fair and balanced way. I appreciate that MORE THAN YOU KNOW. Please don't turn \"left\" on me, Skimm.

{"body":"The skimm does a good job reporting on big topics in the news, but when it comes to any events that could be considered tragedies they fall short. This would be a great place to put in links for people to donate money if they would like to. \n\nAlso for having so many links in the skimm, it should support 3D Touch for the iPhone 6s and 7. It used to in the past and there must have been a bug that was overlooked that disables this.","category":"News","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I should've taken a hint at the logo, however I thought the concept was an interesting take on how to digest news content.\n\nAs soon as I opened the app I was flooded with female-based (and biased) \"news\" content.

Now it\u2019s just the first one when you come to the site, but now it asks me if I want to use the correct browser, so it works (thank you!), and the one in the header. Actually, two in the header, but one goes away when you scroll down. The most annoying one, the one that continually reappeared a the bottom on every new page even after you closed it, is gone. Wooo! I can live with this more modest amount of promotion for the app. The mobile website is useable again, thank you!\n\nAlso, 5 stars because not only is it a good app, but I think you guys may have read my review and made these changes, because it\u2019s so much better! Thank you! Also, sorry my review was kinda harsh, and keep being awesome!\n\nOLD REVIEW:\n\nTitle:  Stop harassing me if I want to use my browser\n\nThis is a protest review against the ridiculous amount of pop ups when trying to view Reddit in a browser. \n\nThere are a minimum of 4 different pop ups to deal with EVERY TIME you try to use your browser. First the \u201cOpen in Reddit?\u201d, then a one that asks me if I want to open in Chrome or the app, and since I\u2019m actually in Safari, nothing happens if I try to tap it, so it just stays there. Then, after tapping that a bunch of times and finally figuring out it doesn\u2019t work, I click on some content only to have a TWO MORE pop ups on that page- one at the top, and one at the bottom. And the one on the top can\u2019t even be made to go away- it just sits at the top of the page, taking up valuable room on a small screen and annoying my eye by being the most noticeable thing on the page with its bright blue button. Then, if you go to another page on the site, the stupid bottom pop up reappears. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Guys, come on. Asking once every time would be annoying enough, but 4 times every visit with a new pop up on every page? Why? \n\nIf I wanted to use the app, I would. It doesn\u2019t have all the functionality of the website in a browser, it\u2019s hard on my battery, sometimes it doesn\u2019t work, and sometimes I just plain feel like using my browser, and I should have the right to do that. Other people may not want to get the app, or maybe they\u2019re a new or infrequent visitor who can\u2019t or doesn\u2019t want to download the app. Either way, I\u2019m not sure why you believe we are incapable of figuring out how we want to view Reddit such that 4 irritating pop ups are needed.\n\nPlease just let us use the website in peace. Get ONE pop up with a \u2018never show me this again option\u2019. I have the app, I know it exists, I like it and use it frequently. I just don\u2019t want to use it every time.\n\nThe app itself deserves 4-5 stars.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Videos and gifs don\u2019t load ever! Some communities are toxic. Just have to find the right small hobby communities.

I have to click \u201cBack\u201d and then click back on the profile and the I can then view the profile with no pop up.

Now they are banning subreddits to please advertisers, and it\u2019s the furthest thing from an \u201copen\u201d platform for all speech and content.

It\u2019s heavily ironic for what they say they stand for. This has happened almost a month ago, and I still received no response as to why I was banned.

{"body":"I love Reddit but, the administrators of Reddit could do to improve HOW they handle certain content. This is not an attack merely a suggestion to the Reddit overseers. Reddit is, at times, considered the final bastion of free speech on the web. We know how FaceBook, YouTube and various other organizations treat users with dissenting opinions. Those who like Donald Trump or promote the idea of free, unrestrained speech are often thrown into a gulag of sorts. I don\u2019t want to see this happen to Reddit although it has already happened to several subreddits. It\u2019s unfortunate. We, as members of Reddit want truly free and unrestricted speech, as granted by the first Amendment of the United States of America. I know MANY people on the far left and far right who agree that Reddit administration has gone overboard with it\u2019s censoring and limiting of certain subreddits. Now, the being said, I AM NOT advocating for groups who violently attack other subreddits or promote promiscuous images of underage girls. I\u2019ve seen how the Reddit admins have handled this and I do agree with a variety of their choices on the matters. Restrictions on some subreddits is a little overboard however, and I would like to see these restrictions removed. MGTOW, The Donald and various other subs are often pushed away as bad while terribly sexist and vile subs such as r\/feminism(who openly hates men and bans any dissenting opinions)are allowed to go unrestricted. I do throughly hope Reddit as a whole developed and changes to reject the idea of the rejection of opinions based on the standards of social justice. All opinions matter and SHOULD be heard. God bless Reddit and thanks for not outright banning things you disagree with, restrictions or no people do appreciate your stance at times. \n\nThis all aside I do like Reddit and find it wonderfully entertaining. Take a look and give it a good go, especially it\u2019s funnier subs like r\/funny. Good times.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

The constant solution is for the individuals to \u201cblock\u201d the trolls, which makes me think the troll arguments are the only thing keeping this website alive\/active.

{"body":"Why must disagreement be instantly the first thing someone thinks of. I love and appreciate criticism but what I receive from some Reddit users is hateful disagreements over tiny disagreements. \n\nThe users think since we don't see 100% eye to eye that they obviously must hate me, or I am obviously of a different political view then them. A constructive argument is not created that way and you guys at Reddit definitely understand this but I'd love to see you point it out. There are hate monger and trolls on here with no purpose other then arouse contempt.\n\nI think there are peaceful people that want a better world full of love and peace and whoever the side is that would not like to see that has made a concerted effort to manipulate the peaceful side into wanting to fight or hate simply because they don't want to. The most peaceful comment or post can be met with severe hate and bigotry or sexism\/racism.\n\nExample: I posted a short video of my daughter watching Brie Larson on GMA and my comments section had two people condemning my actions as projecting my love of Larson onto my daughter, called me schizophrenic, and accused me of not providing a stable environment for my daughter, the most important part of my life, who I will do anything for to ensure she is safe. \n\nI was so upset that day and for what? Because a few people just wanted me to be upset, well it worked and it was a few days ago and I am still upset about it. They wanted me to be mad and I refuse but they did affect me. The pure hate they conveyed should not be allowed and if I worked there and had a say in what goes on the accounts doing this should be immediately deleted or at least punished severely by extended suspension of their accounts. It should also be easy to flag these people and once flagged the punishment should be swift.\n\nThank you\nI love your platform \n\nHere is to world peace! \nChad Harter","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

God forbid you actually like your president because they will belittle you to nothing before you can even share you ideas. Even the news section that happens to be one of the biggest subs to reddit is all Trump this and a Trump that instead  talking about anything worth a read. Personally, I still use the app even though it\u2019s filled with know it alls and quick to judge liberals because I can cut most of it out by not looking at comments and only following subs where political input has no place and even then people will tether Trump to the situation so if you\u2019re already tired by the constant hate parade on Trump then I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be interested in this app.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

Well...currently on the version I just rated,  there\u2019s he tiniest, not really all so important thing...When exiting a draft, you don\u2019t have to option to just abandon it. You either have to save and exit or cancel. A large majority of the time, if I\u2019m exiting a draft, it\u2019d because I changed my mind about writing it.

I think Reddit has fallen to the level of big corporations and should be replaced with something more open and free. It is a discussion website that doesn't allow you to discuss or act until deemed worthy - sounds like \"capitalism\" right? On top of this, it is a giant echo chamber and is controlled by millions of bots, political shills and misinformation. They have become the very thing they fought against. Go outside, talk to your friends, become active in your real life community instead of lining Reddit's pockets and feeding the West's version of China (United Corporations of America).

{"body":"The New Yorker is fantastic. I wrote this review mainly to see if the powers that be at the New Yorker could possibly update their audio availability. Audm is kind of lacking. You can\u2019t easily rewind or fast forward with any accuracy. You can\u2019t speed up. Also, very limited selections of the magazine are available for listening. Not that I\u2019m illiterate, but it is nice to be able to listen to selections when reading isn\u2019t a viable option. For a model to follow, I suggest taking a look at The Economist\u2019s app. The entire magazine is available for listening and done very well with great production value. It would be great to be able to have the functions above (skip forward and listen at variable speeds). Also, I think it\u2019s a bit much to ask me to purchase another app (Audm) when I already pay a pretty fair price for my New Yorker subscription. Again, The Economist does not do this and they set a great example.\n\nOtherwise the app is pretty user friendly. I\u2019d like to be able to bookmark favorite cartoons. Also, as far as audio content is concerned, The New Yorker radio hour is outstanding. Overall, please keep up the fantastic work at The New Yorker!","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

I have closed and opened the App, I have logged out and back in, and even removed and re-installed the App, all with the same result.  It would be OK if this was the only time something went wrong - on at least two occasions in the last three months the magazine completely failed to download, and\/or told me I didn\u2019t have a subscription.

Add to that the fact that unlike any e-reader app this puppy has no pagination. Users are forced to scroll through long article instead of using a seamless way to advance in precise increments. I will have to cancel my subscription if I can\u2019t find a reasonable way to read the magazine.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"So annoying, the app is so buggy it won\u2019t let me subscribe to the New Yorker today using Apple Pay which it offers, and it won\u2019t let me read the articles I want to read without a subscription. The app keeps asking for a shipping address which I have repeatedly entered.\n\nWhen I go to the New Yorker web site they won\u2019t help me because I don\u2019t have a subscription and they send me back to Conde Nasty! I have been trying to subscribe off and on for over two years now. How does the New Yorker survive with a public interface like this?","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"My 89 year old mother reads articles on your app everyday. Since the new release, the text size can not be increased (using the settings option is ineffective) and the app is no longer useable for her.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

I do wish that as subscribers, the bookmarked articles sync to the account so that I can continue reading on different iDevices.","category":"News","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"It\u2019s always annoyed me that I can\u2019t swipe from the left to go back after reading an article \u2014 why not just adopt the standard iOS convention? \u2014 but now ads are auto playing with sound as I scroll. The visual distraction of the animation while trying to read is bad enough. Now I have to be sure to have the volume down so I don\u2019t disturb those around me.

{"body":"Navel gazing at it's best. I go back and forth on the New Yorker, and yet in the end I always feel dirty and dumber to have given them my attention.  They're like that pretty girl in high school. So much beauty, so little brains, such deep insecurity. I know I should have seen through the facade, but I was a kid, I guess. Time to wave goodbye to the NYer and be the adult I am supposed to be. Guys, this is not art.  Art isn't hateful and self-important. That's what reviews are for.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"The New Yorker is a first class weekly periodical that is filled with high quality articles and some very interesting stories about the state of our country & the world.\nIts in depth reporting is usually spot on, & rarely not of interest.

{"body":"I have been subscribing to The New Yorker for decades. It is my favorite magazine by far. But the app has always been terrible and the log-in process has always been circuitous and difficult to manage. I read almost all my periodicals online and this is the only one that I have trouble with. Why doesn't Cond\u00e9 Nast get it together? Their other magazines are a delight in app form. But The New Yorker is a weird pain. Like they don't believe in it and don't put in enough effort as a result. Should be great this many years along and we are out of the \"digital is such a novelty and so secondary to our core business\" phase. Get it together, New Yorker! This is publishing!","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"One of my go-to news sources. Writing is top-notch. Only reason it gets 3 instead of 5 is  it offers only a relatively few \"top stories.\" You can find stuff via the search button, but only if you know the right keywords.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I'm considering ending my NYorker subscription because it is such a hassle to access articles. I'm not sure why the app isn't reflective of their mobile site, where users can browse by section. Only having the top stories and a search bar available make browsing for a read a treasure hunt. Very annoying.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Apparently other readers feel differently, but I read a lot of New Yorker articles on this app with absolutely no problems. No crashes, and easy to read. The cartoons tear off one by one; I couldn't be happier.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The submit button after entering the email and password is not doing anything. \nMany tries; no success.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"A nice imitation in the style of NYTimes daily news brief, but very poor integration for subscribers. Glitchy app doesn't always take passwords and lots of hassle to link accounts. Needs work.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I love to read articles which are not to be found anywhere else.\n\nVery informative articles, educational, and well written.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The app itself is ok. The us is a bit backwards reversing iOS standard patterns by putting the back button and share sheet at the bottom of the screen and making them disappear with scrolling. The experience is disorienting at first, and to be honest does more to confuse than to help.\n\nThe real issue I have, however, is that after I bought the subscription to NYer Today, the app refuses to bind my subscription to the NYer online account I have. So the promise of having access to the New Yorker magazine app and the website? Gone. If only I could cancel my subscription and get my money back, but unfortunately I can't. Customer service has been profoundly unhelpful as well.\n\nUntil the app is fixed, avoid buying the subscription through NYer Today.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"First, it doesn't matter if you can make the font larger, if it only maximizes at a normal font range, the font style is very thin, and the color is grey. If you need reading glasses, it can still be very difficult to read.

{"body":"I've been a subscriber for 30 years. This app is awful -- impossible to sign in.

{"body":"Other publications permit and encourage readers to voice their opinions immediately following\nan article.  Why doesn't \"The New Yorker\" ?  One sided viewpoints lose credibility.  Responders raise issues that give pause.  The editorial board and staff do not have a monopoly on facts or virtue.  Give readers a forum !","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"Exactly what you'd expect from the New Yorker: it's easy to browse through a generous handful of short-to-medium pieces every day, with good support for photos and cartoons. It also includes hyperlinks to other NYer pieces and external pages across the web, which is a thoughtful inclusion from the online edition. It doesn't feel clunky, like the \"mobile magazine\" edition; it feels more like the web, natural and coherent. It's now my daily read, over and above the regular magazine and website. Highly recommended.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

No answer. \n\nWill cancel soon. \n\nIt's too bad their tech team and their customer services departments are so inadequate. \n\nDoes anyone at The New Yorker read these reviews?\n\nI ain't alone. \n\nAnd that's the last feee advice I'm giving to you folks. \n\nShawn Bayer\n\np. s.

I check the news section daily and am always pleasantly surprised how well my liberal views match the articles. It feels like talking, standing beside and laughing with a friend. Do yourself a favor and subscribe to something that delivers horrible truths in the most beautiful way. It's both reason and remedy. I read everyday.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

It keeps telling me to subscribe. It's hard to find previous issues and there's no search feature to find articles. I found the app of a few years ago to be easy to use. The current one is impossible.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"For years this magazine has failed considerably to stay competitive in the e-world. Apps are buggy on an I Phone and lack basic features, such as a button to login when it crashes. This necessitates a call to a less than helpful call center where someone tells me to login in again. Circular incompetence!","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Love my iPhone and love The New Yorker. But the app is a little shaky. It literally shakes at times. That said, my phone has been a little funky since the last iOS update with the cursor bouncing around. In this app, sometimes content jumps back to the previous article without my prompting it to. And the screen shakes. This does not happen in other apps. \n\nHoping Apple and the app developer work out these bugs in the next update!","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"The user interface for this app is great, it's easy to navigate and use. The only complaint I have is that it is sometimes hard to get out of the article you're reading, the back button should be easier to see.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I can overlook the fact that i signed up online for \"instant access\", but then was unable to sign in and have access to the app for almost 48 hours(!) because, in 2016, it takes their system at least 24 to 48 hours to receive my order. \nBut i just found out i have a small limit to how many bookmarks i can keep in app. Between that, and no search function, this is a very, very disappointing and amateurish attempt at an app.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I love the concept. But it is broken in so many ways. This app was clearly on a deadline and released before finished.\n\nYou can't magnify images. So cover page jokes can be indecipherable. \n\n'Cartoons at Random\" is like the Roach Motel - you start looking through cartoons and there's no way back to other content.\n\nI hate that it doesn't know how to rotate on an iPad. You expect such behavior on inferior iPhone apps, but this app tries to scale to larger screens.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Of course the writing is superb and the iPad is a handy way to read the articles but for some reason on my iPad 3 probably less than half the pictures load. This definitely degrades the experience. As another reviewer commented, a picture can be worth a thousand words. I hope this gets remedied.","category":"News","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"It's good to have a way to read updated content from New Yorker writers, but most of the images don't load. On my iPad, and with the New Yorker's excellent published art, that's like missing half the message. Please fix this.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Great writing for sure but the app is not delivering anything close to the writing level. Bookmark function does not sync between devices and Save My Place option means nothing, you have to look for the place where you left off, a cumbersome task if you don't have time to read an article in one sitting. Digital customer support wasn't even aware of the existence of this option, shame.\n\nYou can't rotate the page if you like to read in a horizontal mode which might be ok on the phone but on the iPad it's a burden.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Two issues. First, after downloading the NY Today app, none of the pictures appear with the articles. And, occasionally, a picture is worth a thousand words. Second, after writing this review, I was informed that my nickname was already taken. Then, my review was wiped clean. I needed to type anew.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

Although, I must admit when I was a young girl I really loved the comics and would think about them for some time to try to analyze them like an adult to understand them ! I love the whole collection of stories, essays, articles, memoir, and book reviews , movie reviews , as well as music and art updates and theatrical schedules! All things New York are considered a great measure of what is happening in our country and around the world to me . I do end up spending each week on a Sunday , usually , catching up with my New Yorker . Since it is on my phone now too, I can read it anywhere while I am waiting .

PLUS, there's a section for cartoons only which is an endless source of delight during my commute or just waiting in line somewhere.

This new app brings me happiness :)","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I like the design of this app, and dang near everything about it, except it is missing one crucial feature.  When I exit out of it and restart it, or when the app has been sitting idle and reboots itself it never remembers the place I left off in the article. I have to scroll down each time to find it, which on the longer form articles is a total pain.\nPlease fix this issue!","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

I don't see a reason to have two separate apps to maintain.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This is a great app. Nice cartoon feature and clean interface, along with the always compelling content you'd expect from the New Yorker. But the technical issue of bookmarks and favorites always disappearing without even accessing them has gotten a point where it's very irritating. I scroll the app, find something I want to come back to later by bookmarking it, and then it's gone a few hours later. So I stopped doing it. Yes I can just bookmark it elsewhere, but this needs to be addressed. After several complaints, it still seems to be in progress. I hope they have a fix soon. That's my only qualm. I am not sure if anyone else is having this issue or if I'm just unlucky.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This is basically the iOS version of the New Yorker website, with current content including magazine articles and more. As such, it is a great to have this material available for iOS, especially not having to download full issues as with the magazine app.\n\nThe one big problem, however, is that the font size is humongous, too big on an iPhone and incredibly large on an iPad. I haven't yet found a way to decrease the font size, so prefer to go online for this content.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"A truly unique app, offering new stories and commentary sometimes mixed with older pieces related to a current theme.  \n\nExcellent way to keep up with current events and also get behind a particular story - this app is a solid way to set context for the news. \n\nAs a New Yorker subscriber, I wish I could search for stories, read all posts from a selected author and not be limited in my bookmarks.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Nice improvement over the website and the subscriber app, which to me was a bust since it wasn't optimized for iOS. This one is much easier to navigate and strikes the right balance between give-away content that which is for subscribers only.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

Very happy to have this option and happy to pay for it...to help support an American institution. \nAlso a digital only subscriber to the NY Times. \nI enjoy being able to access great articles on the go and share them with my friends. \nWish this app had a Facebook share button, as the Times does!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"This app is perfect for viewing what's going on with the New Yorker. But often, I find myself in conversation talking about an article that I read and want to pull it up. That's hard, however, because there's no search button in the app. It makes it hard to find articles that I've read before and want to show somebody, but it also makes it hard to find an article somebody wanted to show me. \n\nThe search bar is the only complaint I have, and adding one would absolutely bring my rating up to five stars.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The bar that appears at the bottom of articles while reading them stubbornly stays in place when scrolling. It should disappear as it does in other apps, and, in not doing so, is very distracting to the reader. Also, there should be a way to bookmark favorite cartoons. Otherwise, the app is beautiful.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I usually never write reviews of apps but this app is so elegant and the news are on point. Hits the right spot.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Currently, the app is like a scrolling blog of New Yorker articles, posts and multimedia from the website.  It promises access to the archives with subscription, but does not show the user how to access them.  All magazine content is not included in this app even with a subscription.  Nor is there a link to the full magazine content.  So the magazine app must be retained. It would be better if they integrated the today app with the magazine app.  Persons who subscribed to The New Yorker magazine app via iTunes are not recognized as subscribers by clicking restore subscription. You need to go to the website and link your iTunes subscription so that you can select a user ID and password. It is that NY information that you need to submit in order to have this app recognize you as a subscriber.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This might just be the most convenient (if less classy) way to read New Yorker articles on the subway. You may even want to use it in other places as well.

I thought the $2.99 was Pro and meant I got more but nope. Now I have to pay more money to hear the archives of what just happened. I ponied up $15.00 more bucks and finally listen to my neighborhood feed. I\u2019m worried about my neighbors. \n\nNothing. If they mention what was going on next door, I didn\u2019t hear it. What I did hear seemed to be routine traffic stops. I don\u2019t see fire, even though it\u2019s on the page, maybe that\u2019s the issue, although there was a sheriff car there. For the money, I should not only get access to previous broadcasts, but some kind of translation that tells me what happened. A list of what the numbers they are saying maybe? \u201cOn xyz street, a child has a seizure. On yxz street we have a robbery at Walmart. At zxy street we have domestic violence\u201d. For $20.00, somebody can type this stuff out. \n\nYou don\u2019t need this version if you want to hear live and don\u2019t want archives. Get the free one.

It'll do for now... but keep working on improvements.\n\n2nd: Dropping review to one star because many of the accompanying videos are deceptive.\nExample: Along with an article about a structure fire there is a video with an image that matches the headline. When you click on the video you have to watch a 15 second commercial- which I understand. But when the actual video comes on it is a fluff piece completely unrelated to the headline. What a waste of time.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"This is an update to my review since reading the other reviews on here...I don't see any ads on the new version. And even if I did, I don't mind. However, I do believe that if someone paid for a subscription based on \"no ads\" - then they should receive a refund. I, for one, am loving the idea of being able to read as much as I want for free, and I will tolerate the ads for that specific reason.\n\nThis version is better for me since there doesn't appear to be a forced limit on free articles.\nThe last version had a monthly limit of 10 **free** articles and then you had to pay for a subscription to read anything more that month.  I was never going to pay for a subscription - I don't believe I should be required to pay for information when the paper makes money already on ads. But that's me. I'm willing to tolerate the ads so I can get my info for free. Old school \"over the air\" free TV paradigm. People under 30 won't understand that concept. \n\n****The only thing I don't like about the new version is the real estate section part of the app. I can't get to my saved searches very easily or at all sometimes*******.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I really enjoy having local news in the palm of my hand!  I enjoy staying up to date with our local news.  The only reason I did not give the app 5 stars was because of the advertising.  When you are reading an article and scrolling down you get taken to the advertisers website, link or video.  Not by choice but the placement of the ads forces you to click on them when scrolling while reading an article.  Its extremely frustrating when your in the middle of reading and your all of a sudden taken to an advertisers website or forced to watch their video.","category":"News","sentiment":"neutral"}

Why do I need a notification that a 1 year old is still looking for her 3 year old sister who died in a car crash? Do you really feel the need to notify that three treasure coast children have died since Christmas, after notifying me multiple times about each accident. None of the accidents are worthy of a breaking news alert. It\u2019s like the notifications are trying to be clickbait but are poorly executed. Since Christmas there have been maybe two notifications that are at all worthy of the having breaking news.

Removing from the queue and directly playing works, but finding articles back again is not easy, nor is curating sources \/ authors \/ topics. And resuming articles is hit-or-miss.

No mention in Audm's advertising either. Is that deceptive? \n\nOther minor issues: no playlists and ability to move around the queue. Buffering, when starting a story, is a  buggy ongoing issue.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"While I love the content, the app is awful.  The search function DOES NOT WORK - I search for exact key words from titles and get ALL wrong articles suggested.  FIX THIS!  You can't just exit an article you don't like -- you have to scroll all the way to the end as if you listened to the whole thing, otherwise it stays in your queue and auto plays again after you finish the next article.  FIX THIS!  If you pause an article, it sometimes disappears - you must manually go back and look thru the whole list to find it again and push play.  FIX THIS!  Also, why is there NO ANDROID VERSION???  This app needs serious attention!","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

The narrators are all consistently excellent. The variety of publications is wide.

{"body":"This is such a cool service, partnering with such great sources of long form journalism, and after two days I will be canceling my subscription. \n\nHere are some of the reasons:\n\n-Any audio interruption (ie an alert from google maps, a call, AirPods come out) causes the app to stop, and restarting puts it back about 45 seconds. Very annoying and downright dangerous to try to listen while driving.  \n\n-there is no way to filter content by date. Such a basic thing and such a glaring omission. \n\n-you cannot filter content by more than one publisher at a time\n\n-you cannot filter content by anything other than one publisher at a time. \n\n-search results are listed at random, again no way to filter. You might get something from 2016 as your top hit, and it\u2019s not clear why. \n\n-You cannot subscribe to article sources, topics, anything. Just have to use the inadequate search and filter functionality every time you want to find something to listen to. \n\nThis app is a real disservice to the great work these publishers and narrators are doing.

It does not turn off. My phone battery and headphones ran way down in my purse. I turned it off and clicked out several times to no avail. I had to remove and reinstall.\n\n2. When one story ends suddenly an unfinished one starts. I tried to adjust it but it keeps happening.  Makes no sense. Who wants to finish one and have the middle of another thrust upon us?

Greatdreamer1980 must have been paid off to change his review, and it is to the credit of the developers that they have allowed the original one to stand. It is still completely accurate in my experience.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I am an audiobook addict, and I was so excited to discover Audm. It\u2019s like having an audio subscription to the best magazine journalism out there at a much lower price than subscribing to the audio versions of the magazines individually, and not all are even available that way. Audm almost always has the articles I want to read, and the app is easy to use.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"For someone who walks for exercise and enjoyment, Adam is the perfect companion. An hour long walk will not only improve my health but also my world view! The stories on Adum are ones that I would normally read anyway, so it also opens up time that I can other things ... i love this app!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I will not continue with a paid subscription after the free trial period ends. The first and only article I tried to listen to, from the New Yorker, stopped and stuttered and skipped repeatedly like an old LP. Clearly there are still significant bugs to be worked out.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The Audm service has provides me with a way to explore deeper journalistic works than the newspaper or NPR. While I subscribe and read a couple of weightier magazines, the length of some articles is a chore. Having the same article read to me is a treat. \nThe readers do an excellent job of making the articles intelligible and the app allows you to adjust the speed to fit your mood.","category":"News","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"Excellent range of articles read by excellent readers. Excellent customer service. Real people!  \n\nI\u2019ve been using Audm the minute I need a rest from distressing podcasts. \n\nBecoming essential. \n\nAnd stunningly good customer service.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The quality of the narration is very good, and Audm does a nice job curating the articles that show up in the feed. If a piece of long form journalism is making the rounds, I can count on it showing up in the app. I mostly use it when I\u2019m driving or tidying up, so it\u2019s great for when I otherwise wouldn\u2019t have an hour (or more) to sit down and read that one story I\u2019ve been meaning to get to.\n\nBut there\u2019s another advantage that I haven\u2019t seen the developer mention: Audm partners with the outlets that provide their content, so it lets you support high quality journalism without it feeling like a sacrifice (e.g., turning off Adblock) or charity (e.g., paying for stuff you can already read for free). You pay for it, *and* you get more out of it.\n\nThe app is attractive, stable, and user friendly, but there\u2019s still room for improvement. I\u2019d like to see it integrate with read-it-later services like Pocket, so that articles I\u2019ve saved for later are automatically added to my Audm queue as they become available, and automatically archived in the read-it-later app after I\u2019ve listened to them on Audm. An ability to search the text of articles would also be nice. But even without these bells and whistles, it\u2019s worth the price.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Since joining Audm I\u2019ve become a fan of podcasts as a wonderful source of discovery and learning. Audm offers a wide range of quality writing from some of my favorites including The New Yorker, The Atlantic, outside, Vanity Fair, London Review of Books and many others. I commute, so I can listen to articles I never had time to read. I feel better informed since Audm entered my life.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I love Audm. I listen to articles while skiing, walking, gardening, doing housework-- anytime I'm alone. The readers are excellent.

{"body":"I love this app. Not all my favorite magazines are represented (yet), but to walk and listen to an article and perhaps go back and finish reading it, or even read along, is just great. I like how the article moves up your screen and you can navigate it. The readers are great.  Please add more magazines.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

I love reading The New Yorker, The Atlantic, NYT, etc., but it\u2019s not easy to find the time to finish such long articles when you\u2019re a busy teacher like myself! So now I browse the articles and listen to them on my commute up the 405 (yikes). The narrators are excellent as well.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I am still a huge fan of the Audm app.  I have been able to enjoy far more high quality, long-form journalism than I was able before since now I can (and do) listen while doing housework, while walking anywhere, and while commuting in the car.  I subscribe to the print version of many of the journals covered but my opportunities to relax with them are limited, and has been a source of frustration.  Audm has also led me to some really fantastic coverage of topics of interest to me from regional journals and papers that I would otherwise see. Audm has made it possible for me to satisfy my curiousity about what is going on (politics, economics, social policy, and everything else) without having to listen to superficial news bullitand or histerical commentery. The pieces read on the app are the best of what is available: well researched, responsibly reported, carefully composed. Such a huge step up from the other things available for listening, like radio news and commentary, chatty podcasts, etc.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I listen to probably 85% of the articles chosen, because they peak my interest and are timely. In a diverse culture like ours... THAT's HUGE. Covering politics, social controversy, fascinating art and history articles, biographies, book reviews, outdoor adventures, and drawing from the very finest periodicals (magazines) available in English, there is always something new and different to absorb. Being a slow reader with a thirst for interesting information, I utilize Audm on a daily basis \u2013 as I wind down at night, while I do chores or gardening or artwork. Occasionally, the article is so important\/riveting, I'll sit down and use the always-available-but-optional read-along feature. The text tracks with the reader's progress and one can scroll up or down and rehash sections with a simple tap. Background-playing while one works with other apps is also a big PLUS. With its unique read-along feature, I would also recommend this to ESL students. Ten-thumbs-up for Audm!\nMaybe Audm will expand to Italian or German news magazines soon.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

I get to \u2018read\u2019 articles from the magazine I subscribe but never got around to read, plus more. \n\nNot all readers are perfect. I listen in the car so very deep male voice is a problem. I tinkered with the radio to make the voice higher and this seemed to help. Some readers also read a little too fast for my taste. But all in all it\u2019s a very useful app.\n\n[could you use VirginiaListener as my name? Thank you! I can\u2019t find where to put down my name.]","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I hardly ever review the products I buy or resources I use, but AUDM has become an invaluable resource to me.  I discovered it when recovering from eye surgery just over a year ago, and realized it would be a great way to spend hours spent in a face-down recovery position while not actually reading.  I've used it a huge amount ever since, and recommended it to many friends and colleagues who I know love longform journalism but are busy and often on the go, and therefore unable to get to magazine articles they might want to read.  I use this app while driving, running, on the elliptical, doing dishes, folding laundry, even walking the dog when I don't feel like being sociable!  It's straightforward, carried a good number of publications, gets current articles up pretty quickly, and produces great-quality recordings.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"From another review I see that they have recently quadrupled their development team. This is great because there is so much potential for this app. I use Audm to listen to those New Yorker magazine articles which I don\u2019t have time to read in the print version. Also, I am listening to stuff from magazines that I wouldn\u2019t subscribe to, but might after hearing their content.\nSome things to work on: I use an iPod and I can only download about 10 hours of content for offline listening without making the app unusable. This wouldn\u2019t such a problem except that there is <strong>no way to bookmark or create a wishlist of things I want to listen to later<\/strong>. There is a ton of good stuff in the archives and I have resorted to taking screen shots to remember what is available. Also, <strong>some sort of index or way to see what is in the archive without scrolling forever<\/strong>. Even a plain txt list of titles with a few words description next to it. I look forward to the improvements. I think that, with the excellent content, you could really increase your user base with improvements like the ones listed above.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is one of my absolute favorite apps of the entire year, which I discovered reading a New Yorker article. It\u2019s one of those apps that had me mumbling, \u201c...now why didn\u2019t I think of that?!\u201d  It\u2019s so simple and elegant -- and ultimatley deeply important to the future of long-form journalism. There are so many times that I want to read a long, in-depth article but time gets away from me and I never finish. And reading on a device is so tedious. This app reads the articles -- and  uses top tier voice artists. I listen to it on my commutes to work, cooking, walking the dog. It\u2019s starting to replace some of my favotire podcasts in terms of time.  I\u2019m madly in love with this app and believe in it\u2019s potential to dominate the audio space.

{"body":"I love using Audm ....There is an amazing array of publications, narrated by people who have the most beautiful voices on earth. The offerings are so varied, that I can always find something I\u2019m in the mood to listen to. As well,  I\u2019m able to listen to as much or as little of an article as I can when walking, driving a car or exercising and it\u2019s  easy to go back to an unfinished article without losing my place. \nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without this app!!!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"There are so many great long-form articles coming out on a regular basis from Atlantic, New Yorker, and many other magazines. To be able to sit down and read them all is a daunting task. When I discovered Audm I was so happy. The articles come out in a timely manner, the readers are great, and I can listen while walking or driving. Highly recommended!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I use this app every day while I drive or at the gym to catch up on articles I\u2019d otherwise probably never get to read. Best part: there is no longer a pile of magazines stacked up beside my bed, waiting for me to read them.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"When Audm came to my attention, it is as if someone was reading the wish list in my head. Audible is great for books, and even the daily read of the WSJ -- but most of the time I was reading the pieces in my list of quality subscriptions (e.g., New Yorker, Atlantic, etc). Some of the articles were podcast-related, etc. -- but having access to relevant and decent quality long form pieces was difficult.\n\nNot only does the coverage of Audm match 80% of my subscriptions, but its offerings have introduced me to new publications.\n\nIn one or two cases I found the tone of the readers a bit off -- in one case the material and tone were so far off that I went back to the hard copy. Many long form nonfiction have to be read with an appreciation of the audience rather than as a piece of dramatic fiction. But that is minor issue and I still give this app and service a five!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I have been greatly enjoying Audm. It is a convenience to be able to listen to interesting articles when doing things which make reading them impossible (driving, household chores). The selection is interesting and varied, and the readers are excellent.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I love this and have recommended it to all my friends and colleagues. It\u2019s a pleasure to have professional actors read long articles to you. This is different from other podcasts I like, such as Ted Radio, in the sense that you hear ONE writer putting things together for you, making all the arguments and come to some conclusions at the end. The writing is generally high quality which is so important. There is something calm and pleasant about hearing stories read. The articles are also diverse so one get exposed to areas of knowledge that is unfamiliar. (I will vote for more sciences in the future.)","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I am a long-time lover of audio books and podcasts and I have long thought it would be wonderful if there were an app that would do for magazine articles what Audible does for books.

I scan the articles available to \u201cread\u201d, and pick what I\u2019m going to listen to. With headphones on, I can engage in other activities while listening to a fascinating article. The readers are very good and there is a diversity of articles. Some, I must admit, are quite lengthy, and require a commitment of time which I don\u2019t always have.

{"body":"Your typical online critic will sacrifice the excellent on the alter of the perfect.  It\u2019s truly infuriating and challenging to sort through all the blather.  That said, Audm is probably my favorite app.  Yes, okay, it has some\u2014occasional\u2014bugs (and what app doesn\u2019t?), but none truly interfere with the benefits and content of this unique app.  I have listened to hours upon hours of articles that I otherwise wouldn\u2019t  have time to read.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker:  When I question a performance glitch in the app with a message to customer service\u2014I\u2019ve done this twice\u2014I get a response from one of the co-founders within the hour.  Really!  Neither of the problems I experienced were deal killers.  Like every other app out there, Audm is not perfect.  But it\u2019s developers stand behind it and listen.  For that, I cheer for the excellent and thumb my nose at the perfect!\n\nThanks and keep the informative content coming!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

But sometimes I just need something to listen to (doing the dishes, folding laundry, driving for more than 10 minutes). I've never been that impressed with most podcasts, but Audm is the perfect solution. I pick the articles I am most interested in, from my favorite publications (and others I am just now discovering), and hear them read by excellent voice actors, over 30-60 minutes.

The app had some weird issues in 2017 that I had to fix by reinstalling the app, but I can\u2019t recall any problems in all of 2018.\n\nThe amount of content has vastly increased since 2017, and the quality of the publications, authors, and narrators has remained at a very high level.\n\nMy only complaint, and it might not even be up to Audm, is the title and one sentence descriptions of the New Yorker articles are always cryptic. I love the New Yorker, probably the best publication in the country, but I\u2019m not going to commit to an hour long listen when the only info going in is Title: Hard News and Description: The state of journalism. Surely such a long piece could have a bit more of a synopsis. Every New Yorker read is similarly blunt. Unlike a print magazine or a website (where the article may also be linked from somewhere that gives it context), it\u2019s not quite as easy to flip through the content to decide if it strikes interest.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

One of my greatest joys is listening to the audiobooks of Mr. Caro\u2019s Years of Lyndon B Johnson series, which are read by Grover Gardner. I estimate that I\u2019ve spent at least 1,500 hours listening to Mr. Gardner\u2019s wonderful voice narrating Mr Caro\u2019s complex but fascinating text\u2014 Caro\u2019s dense, muscular writing must be seen on the page in order to fully appreciate what a truly impressive job Gardner does bringing it to life. \n\nIn fact it was Grover Gardner\u2019s presence as a frequent narrator on the Audm app that led to my subscription. I don\u2019t pass up opportunities to listen to him read, and I took it as a good indication of the quality of the content. And so far I\u2019ve been impressed. Obviously they\u2019re still building out the content, but they\u2019re clearly ambitious. New articles are added almost daily, and they even have some great selections from the archives. And the narrators are generally excellent. Julia Wheelan is a new favorite of mine who I discovered on Audm. \n\nYesterday I opened up the app and saw a New Yorker article by Robert Caro about his approach to research. I clicked on it, hoping so hard it would be read by Grover Gardner... it was. Made me so happy.

The bad: Unexpected app crashes, the long time lag until you can begin downloading stories and save them to your queue, the inability to re-listen to or delete stories in your history, and very quirky downloading of several articles at once. If you just *tap* on an article in your history, the app crashes. If Pocket is an A+, Audm is currently a C-.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The content and quality of the articles is very good. Even the narrators do an excellent job. I found myself looking forward to the articles and content, unfortunately the only issue is the app functionality itself. CarPlay might as well not even be part of the app as it doesn\u2019t work (following uninstall and reinstall). The follow along text is a great idea, if it didn\u2019t do a bizarre refresh every paragraph. And what gives with the 2 day trial - you can\u2019t even sample the content effectively.  It\u2019s the little things unfortunately that hurt this potentially excellent user experience.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"Content = Amazing. \n\nUsability = Utterly crazy making. \n\nI redownloaded the app today after letting it go dormant for over a year, because I was prompted to use it to listen to Buzzfeed\u2019s article \u201cHow Millennials Became the Burnout Generation\u201d. The irony is not lost on me, and it won\u2019t be lost on you if you\u2019ve read it either. \n\nI can never seem to get to read the longform journalism I crave because my to-do list is a systemically never ending abyss... So, let\u2019s listen to journalism instead while optimizing my time by readying myself for the day making-the-coffee-eating-breakfast-attending-to hygiene-and-grooming AND getting my thought provoking entertainment in. \n\nBut instead, I\u2019m chained to hitting pause-play after Every Single Paragraph because the audio is consistently interrupted. Worse, every time I restart the audio, I find it picks up the story at whatever point it would be if it had continued playing, so when I sprint across the room to hit pause-and-play I\u2019ve missed the first few words or sentences of the next paragraph and have to rewind (or whatever the non-analog version of that is called these days) and hope that I don\u2019t end up having to listen to the last paragraph all over again, only to have it stop at the same exact point AGAIN once the repeated paragraph is complete. \n\nMy blood pressure is spiking just thinking about it. As an older cusp-millennial I get the existential angst And the awareness of the precarious state of an aging body. I was determined to get through the article, so I developed an optimized system, as we do, to take the initiative and keep an eye on the scrolling content for every paragraph break so I could preemptively pause it and play it myself, thank you very much. Unfortunately, this kept me from stealing the moment of enjoyment I might have gleaned from my morning, and instead I\u2019m writing this exasperated review. \n\nI don\u2019t remember why I ditched this app the last time, but I\u2019m not sure I can subject myself to that kind of torture again any time soon. Should I give it another year for you to continue to iron out the kinks? Or is it just because I\u2019m still on a 6 and your priority isn\u2019t geared toward updating the software for older equipment?

Right now there is a huge wait time before the app is functional and it\u2019s prone to crash while loading. If you don\u2019t use the app for awhile it closes down and you have to reload again.

{"body":"This app has an incredible selection of articles, well read, and it\u2019s nice that one can read along in sync with the audio. \n\nBut the app itself needs work. A couple of important issues: 1) If I am listening to an article, press pause, and then go to another app, the app often seems to just die in the background, so that if I press pause on my headphones again, music starts playing instead. This happens far less frequently in the audible app or in any of the podcast apps I\u2019ve tried, but it happens constantly in Audm, and really degrades the experience of using the app. 2) I wish the app would give me more information about the content I\u2019m listening to. For example, it includes some articles from old issues of the New Yorker (which is wonderful), but I can see no way of finding out when each article was written. 3) When I start up the app after not using it for a while, I have to navigate to the queue and find the thing I was listening to most recently. I would strongly prefer to go straight to it. \n\nI want so badly for these things to be fixed, because I love the content, but I find myself not using the app much, particularly because of my first issue.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I\u2019ve been listening to, and enjoying, Audm for a while. Biggest problem was that it kept trying to make me listen again to something I\u2019d already listened to, or stopped listening to on purpose. Finally figured out to delete the stories-that-would-not-die. Now, when I try to delete such a story, the app quits. If I come back and try to listen to another story . . . The app quits. Tried deleting the app, restarting the device (iPhone or iPad) and downloading the app again. No luck. Tried going to support web page to submit a bug report, not an option. Hoping a lousy rating score will get someone\u2019s attention. Very quick bug fix, please!","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"While this app has incredible content, it has one of the most frustrating UXs ever. It frequently takes the discover pane multiple seconds to load, if it ever does. Good luck if you filter by magazine and try and scroll down to past issues - those load about 10% of the time. This is extremely basic search functionality and the app fails at this. I\u2019m very unimpressed.\n\nUpdate: lowering my review to one star because it won\u2019t even play downloaded content at 1.25x speed on Bluetooth - it mutes the audio when it ends a paragraph on the scrolling text playing at anything about 1x speed playback. It plays content at 1x, but there are weird little blips in the audio when it ends a paragraph too. Honestly, it\u2019s embarrassing how much content this app has but how horrible it is at delivering it. The minimum viable product here is so simple (discovery + playback), and it is just deeply broken.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I would love this app if the following weren\u2019t true:\n1. It\u2019s agonizingly slow to start up. \n2. Despite the option to download stories for later, it still requires a network connection to play them. Unless you have an unlimited data plan, don\u2019t even think of using it on cellular data\u2014the stories consume huge amounts of data. \n3. The actual content offered draws primarily from about 3 sources, though they list 10 times that number.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I absolutely love it. Of course app could be more functional, but it will evolve. \nWith time constraints we all have, I would like ratings, so I don\u2019t miss something really important, which might be out of my routine sphere of interest.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The content consists of complete issues of The New Yorker and The Atlantic, and bits and pieces of other magazines. I don\u2019t like Atlantic, and the other magazines are occasionally good but usually not. The New Yorker is my favorite magazine. Audible also has an audio edition of The New Yorker. Audm usually has one or two more articles than the Audible version. However, the Audible app is so much better than the Audm app. The Audible app opens in seconds, you download the file in maybe ten or twenty seconds, and you can listen whenever you want. The Audm app takes five to ten minutes to open on my iPhone 6s, if it opens. Downloading an article takes ten to twenty minutes. Then there are long pauses in the article. The articles are available for a week, then they vanish. The Audm app appears to be streaming files rather than downloading files, and their servers appear to be overloaded, causing long waits and pauses in the streaming. I gave up on Audm and I\u2019m going back to Audible. Audible is also half the price of Audm.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I wish I could write a better review for this app, but really I just wish this app worked better. The content is great -- exactly the kind of long-form journalism I like to read, but generally don't have time to get to. It's more substantive and less gimmicky than most podcasts, which is refreshing. \n\nThe app, though, is exasperating. Articles often pause for 10-20 seconds at paragraph breaks. Occasionally they just stop, and you have to start them again. A few times articles have stopped in the middle and then completely disappeared from my phone. I reported this to the developers months ago, and they initially responded, but lately I've sent a couple follow-ups and gotten no response. I've installed all of the updates, but the problems are the same. It also takes forever to load, and sometimes crashes when I'm trying to edit the cue. \n\nPersonally I wish they'd make the content available in the iTunes store as a regular podcast that I can play in the iOS podcast app. Maybe some people like the option of reading the text as well as listening, but I've got plenty of apps like Pocket for reading. What I want from this app is a reliable, non-buggy way to listen to good journalism. Unfortunately at this point it has the good journalism, but the non-buggy part is still in development.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Huge fan of the long content the app provides. Such a great idea and looking forward to making my way through the catalogue.\n\nSome problems: The app is slow to load older stories as you scroll through, and it would be great to filter by topic (Crime, Tech, Politics, History, Literature) and length instead of just by provider. There are hundreds of pieces but it\u2019s difficult to find the older ones.","category":"News","sentiment":"neutral"}

But when I play articles in my car the Audm app will suddenly trigger the playing of music from my library.\nNone of my other audio apps have this problem.\nUntil Audm fixes this, the app and the service are useless.

Any time you pause it, it crashes in the background, so you end up reopening it over and over. \n\nOthers here have posted in support of the developer\u2019s customer support, but what good is that if they don\u2019t fix the underlying errors in their programming. This kind of behavior might be tolerable in an free app, but I am sadly beginning to conclude that nothing is likely to change. I don\u2019t plan to pay for this kind of non-performance much longer.

{"body":"Things have improved somewhat with this app but it still has some serious issues. I loads a bit faster but hard to tell if that is the app or iOS 12. \n\n1. You listen to an article in your queue and it automatically deletes. You start the next article. It abruptly stops and the previous article is downloading itself. I delete it. It starts downloading again. This happened 6 times with one article yesterday, the last about 10 minutes into the second article. Infuriating!\n\n2. Pause doesn\u2019t mean \u201cpause until I hit play again\u201d. Pause sometimes only lasts a few seconds, sometimes longer before it automatically starts playing again. You have to close the app to ensure it won\u2019t randomly start playing again. Incredibly annoying!\n\n3. Once you put an article in your Queue, you no longer have access to the article summary or the date it was published. You should be able to see that same summary info from the Discover tab. Very annoying!\n\n4. When editing you Queue, the same issue with redownloads of deleted content mentioned in item 1 occurs. Sometimes it reverts to the old list after you haves moved pieces up in the queue. Infuriating!\n\n5. On the Discover tab, you find an article (or 10) that you save to your queue. Then you see another article you want to listen to right away. The downloading articles in the queue get priority over the one you are trying to play. You have to wait for everything else to download before you can listen to the article you want to hear. The article that you click Play on should have priority downloading over ones you save for later. \n\n6. Need more playback options in the queue such as \u201cPlay from bottom\u201d where it plays articles in reverse order from when you added them to the queue. Handy if several shorter articles of timely content get published that you want to listen to together and don\u2019t want to hassle with reorganizing the queue. Also an option that if I listen to the 6th story in my queue to have it then go to the 7th story, not the 1st one.

I don't have to choose either\/or - I can have both!  I can be productive, while getting in some awesome content. And it definitely helps with boring house chores like dishes, vacuuming, and laundry.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I love this concept. In fact, I talk about this app to everyone, despite its miserably unstable nature and poor search functions. It will constantly crash mid article, causing me to reboot the whole thing. It\u2019d be one thing if it were free, but paying a premium should mean getting premium content and delivery.

{"body":"I really want to love this app! The readers are excellent, and there are more than enough high-quality selections to listen to. But ... Lordy! the app is practically user-hostile. It's missing a number of features that a good audio app should have, such as bookmarking, a sleep timer, a way to download articles for off-line listening, smart playlists, etc. Worse, it crashes constantly and requires me to sign in with my Apple ID every time I open it \u2014\u00a0and worse still, keeps insisting that I sign in even when I close the app. Although it's allegedly set up for family sharing, my husband and I can't set up separate queues or even listen to the same article at the same time using our own devices. A great idea, poorly executed. I've cancelled our subscirption.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

The content was great but the app was so bad that it could hardly open half the time. \n\nBut much has changed since then, and I even had the opportunity to chat with one of the developers and describe one of the bugs that had been plaguing the app in order to help it improve. Now I gladly pay what I consider a nominal fee for such great content. This is the first app I open in the mornings to listen to while I get ready and my go-to app for when I\u2019m commuting. I can\u2019t imagine how my life would be without it.\n\nI hope the devs keep on improving and innovating. It would be great to be able to preferentially choose which publications make it to my home screen . It would also be nice to have the ability to favorite some stories in order to find them easier. Personally, I have stumbled upon some amazing long form reporting that I would not have ever found had it not been for your app, but I don\u2019t ever want to forget about them. Your app makes it so easy for these invaluable stories get lost after they have been played. Lastly, please consider integration with pocket so that users can save the stories or their web links for easier sharing. I know not everyone has this app or is willing to pay but if I could easily charge the link where the story is online, it would make it easier for discussion . \n\nOverall, amazing growth and improvement in the stability of the app and I hope to see continued support in the future ! \n\nBest wishes","category":"News","sentiment":"neutral"}

Great journalism is out there but it\u2019s hard to find the time to sit down and read the stuff, so Audm provides audio recordings, read by some of the best professional narrators, of recent high quality content from the New Yorker, The Atlantic, and other publications. The only problem is that not nearly enough content makes it onto the app. I pay $7 per month and will gladly continue to do so if only there was more content appearing every day that I can listen to. Instead I find myself using it only once in a while since I quickly exhaust all the articles that come up. Great articles appear every day all over the internet.

Amazing content, great interface.  Makes life better.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I'm blown away by all aspects of this app. First off, the content is no less than premium. The New Yorker addition has been phenomenal. Enthralling articles that are so well written that you can't help but to lose track of time while listening. This is a big difference from many podcasts out there. The narration adds a level of quality that most rough podcasts miss. Second, the user experience is flawless. Easy to keep track of your articles and with the new update the app has been stable with no issues. Can't wait to see what else comes out. Listening during my commute has been a godsend. I love that there is a variety of short and long articles. Keep up the great work!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Amazing concept and content.  If you love long form journalism, but are too busy to read the latest articles, this app is great.  The content readers are excellent as well as is the selection.  \n\nThat all being said, the app is a bit frustrating.  The developer needs to add controls to sort, filter, and search.  I\u2019m sure that\u2019s on their roadmap.\n\nI gave the app 5 stars because since signing up, I\u2019ve listened to at least an article a day and think this is a great concept.  If you love audiobooks, this will be right up your alley.  So, in this instance, I don\u2019t mind it being a work in progress.

{"body":"Update:  within hours of leaving the review, the company had reached out to me and resolved the issue. Great customer support: I can see that this app is a labor of love for the Audm crew.  Again, if you are a reader of the Atlantic, London Review of Books, and similar literary magazines, the content will absolutely speak to you (I couldn't resist the pun).  Ive updated the review to four stars and am hoping that the app will now prove stable.  If so, it is bargain at the subscription rates.   \n\nOld Review: I wasn't sure how many stars to award.   I've subscribed for quite a few months and what seems like poorly executed updates.  On one hand, I love the content and the readers are first rate:  they read with assurance and emotion.   On the other hand,  there have been so many updates, so many bugs. For the longest time, the app would keep asking me to verify my account--invariably after I had just begun a long drive and couldn't safely enter my password.  The developers fixed that one, then the ones that followed.  Another long running bug was getting a different selection than I loaded.   They seem to have fixed that one now.  Another update today and I can't even get to the content stream.  I just keep looking at the black screen with the logo.   I've restarted my phone without any consequence.   By rights, I should give one star since I'm currently getting no use out of an app for whichI am paying.   I should cancel my subscription.   I know I should.   And, yet, I think to all the long Southern California commutes that this app has enlivened and enlightened.   I want to love this app. I really do.","category":"News","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"Like most of its subscribers, I love the content of this app.  Audm utilizes riveting articles from some of the most erudite English-language magazines in the world\u2014the New Yorker, the Atlantic, the New York Review of Books\u2014and had them narrated by speakers who uniformly have superb diction, inflection and pitch. Like many subscribers, I was annoyed when the app crashed, but also struck by the company\u2019s urgency to correct the issue.  When I couldn\u2019t get it up and functioning again, even with the repair, I sent an email to Co-founder Christian Brink, who immediately responded, told me how to correct the problem and then followed up to make sure all was well.  Audm is a great app, but most of all this is a tech company that takes customer service seriously.  I\u2019m a fan of the product, but most of all of the people behind it.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

All the best long-form journalism from venerable journalistic outfits read by great narrators.  What more could you ask for?  How many apps make you a better citizen?  Not only that, the responses from the Audm team are immediate and very helpful.  The app is somewhat spartan, but it is stable and improving with each update.

{"body":"Very perplexed about how frequently the stories stop after just 30 seconds, maybe a minute or two, and then continue to stop repeatedly until you give up on the possibility of listening to a full article. It seems to be an issue with autolock, but not exclusively. It even occurs when song is fully downloaded. This hasn\u2019t changed since the last update. Three weeks seems like a long time in between updates for an app with this many issues. I\u2019m pretty sure I began using audm almost as soon as it launched, and I love the concept. I use it all the time, despite how painful it can be. It\u2019s gotten much better, but the problems that still exist are astounding. Yes, the last few months there have been huge strides, but how is it that I still can\u2019t listen to an article all the way through without it stopping, freezing or crashing? It\u2019s been out for more than a year right? I sometimes wonder what boardroom of geniuses decided this app was \u201cready for the public\u201d. I also find it curious that often when someone comments about the horrible app functionality and experience issues, the developer comments \u201csorry you\u2019re one of the small number of people who have issues\u201d \u2014 I respect how responsive your team is, but it is clearly not just a small number, can we just be open about this? Or at least not lie? I think we all want to support this app, don\u2019t make it even harder. I\u2019ve tried to think of my monthly subscription as a \u201cdonation\u201d to hopefully keep the developers in business long enough to get this app up to par, but honestly I have to avoid calculating how much I\u2019ve spent over the last year because it\u2019d probably bum me out. As a journalist, I always think about recommending it to my reporter friends as a great way to get more \u201creading\u201d in... it\u2019s getting close to being \u201crecommendable\u201d but at the moment I think I\u2019d still be too embarrassed.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

Sometimes, not always, the app takes a really long time to start, I mean 5-10 minutes of waiting for it to load.

Al this makes this offering now almost perfect and I\u2019m super happy having returned as a subscriber!\n\nOld review: Just to be clear: The content offered is first class. A great selection of some of the finest journalism the US\/UK has to offer (only the New Yorker is missing). Unfortunately the app is frustratingly buggy that I gave up: Frequent crashes, articles stop playing right in the middle, downloads not working, button in-active (e.g. the \"+\" button to start a download works approx. every 10th time for me...), downloads suddenly vanishing (especially frustrating when you boarded a 12 hour flight and were looking forward to listening to some articles) etc. \nUnfortunately the app also did not improve at all over the last few weeks - which is annoying as the problems are so glaring that also the developers have to be aware of them.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

The articles and sources are top notch, and the readers are clear and expressive at various speeds.\n\nThe app, however, is slow, often unresponsive, and sometimes crashes. It doesn't make use of standard iOS gestures or UI elements, and it doesn't provide enough visual feedback to indicate a user's interaction has been noticed by the app. (For example, selecting download for later doesn't give any feedback that it was tapped. The share button doesn't seem to work at all while listening to a story.)\n\nI'd love to see the app use native UI and implement better feedback.

I've tried to be patient but it hasn't been a useful program for almost a month. I'd appreciate at least one free month to try to keep up my interest.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Interesting idea but the forced subscription and limited content inhibit a positive user experience. To try out the app, you have to subscribe. Sure you can cancel the 3 day trial but good luck with that. You can't even cancel within the app. There should be free preview content. Even an excerpt of a story would be better than a forced subscription. Normally, I would delete an app with this gym membership style of subscription. Instead, I signed up  and set a reminder to cancel my subscription. Now, to the content. I came here because of an Atlantic article. The article was fine. The readers voice took a little getting use to. It was a little to monotone and was hard to focus on at first. During the article I was annoyed how frequently the current US president's name and actions were mentioned, especially when it wasn't necessary. I don't like him nor this constant obsession with him. You might think this has nothing to do with the app. When I took a look at the other news sources, I realized that they are mostly unabashedly left wing sources. Even the technology magazine Wired has drifted from its roots in order to find a new audience. I'm looking for both sides to the story. A little left and a little right. Most of us are not extreme right or left. I want compelling stories without the petty drama. In an app like this, there needs to be more moderate content. I understand that this could change in the future. More  international sources would be great too. I know you've got to start somewhere and this is a good start. I might give this app another chance. I'm just not sure I will want to pay in the future to find out if the app has improved.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"As other review mention, the selection quality, long-form journalism made available for walks, car rides, etc. has been very enjoyable, although expensive. But the app itself has been very disappointing and frustrating. Running on iPhone 7 128GB version with latest iOS. It is slow to load and very unreliable while playing. If I begin play and have my screen shut off, it stops playing. In a 50 min audio article, I have had to open my phone (and the app, since control through Control Center doesn't seem to work) about 10 times to restart the audio. I went to the Audm website for troubleshooting or support, but found nothing.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

App is slow, especially navigation and performance in 4G areas. Used the app extensively at our Aspen retreat and Rocky Mountains roadtrip. Audible and Apple podcast and Spotify worked just fine. Not Audm. Simple caching is itself missing.\n\n2. Content is great. Much better than anything out there.\n\n3. Pricing is off at 6.99.

I am always recommending it to others - whether it's my 70 year old mother in law who likes to listen to books on tape or my 24 year old cousin who commutes an hour to work each way...love this app.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I subscribed basically when Audm launched. No other service on the market works with better publishers or curates better content. I've discovered new publishers through Audm and gotten through articles I'd be scrambling to find the time to read anyway. The app is easy to use and intuitive. Now I can't live without Audm!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

I just want them to produce more content. Can't get enough!\n\nI absolutely love Audm!  I appreciate the wide range of articles, and in particular, the ones that focus on social and educational issues. The narrators are spectacular. I recommend this app wholeheartedly.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I stumbled across this app after seeing their audio on The Atlantic's page. I've never really had the patience for longer articles. Audm delivers this great journalism in wonderful audio form, which I listen to on my long commute. I don't particularly like podcasts. To me, this is way better. I've been recommending Audm to colleagues who also have longer commutes to work.\n\nThis is a gem of an app!  The stories are just terrific, nicely narrated and selected for a wide variety of interests. The political pieces are particularly compelling and now more than at any other time in US history has there been a need for in-depth articles that are articulate, concise, and deeply relevant. Bravo!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I have long been a fan of long form journalism and for that reason will sometimes hoard magazines like Esquire or The Atlantic (and many others) because of that one piece I haven't yet read that without fail proves so informative and fulfilling to read.  And now - to see this App that curates those articles and has them read by a VARIETY of PROFESSIONAL readers (if you subscribe to the New Yorker on Audible you\u2019ll know why I\u2019m emphasizing this) is INCREDIBLE.  And hey folks - for quality you can't have free - the monthly cost is oh so worth the experience provided.  I often find myself showing up to meet friends or loved ones after being immersed in a story and just having to gush about the experience I just had and then try to relay the things I learned that day.... so worth it!!!  Please stay Audm, we need you, especially now - the diverse coverage on politics has been a refreshing change from the echo chamber I'm immersed in.   Great app, great content, great and diverse narration, just great.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"The concept behind this app is great. As a frequent podcast listener, this app allows me to consume news content in the same manner as a podcast -- in such a way that allows me to multitask.\n\nThe app is well organized, elegant, and has high quality audio. But it could be even better if there was a way to filter the audio articles so that they can be ranked in terms of length or popularity. Hopefully, The New Yorker will be added to this app one day.\n\nThe support staff is very helpful and friendly. The app is sometimes slow when loading the settings or main menu pages, but otherwise works fine.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I want to like this app because I like the content.  However, it is a slow and quirky app.  It takes several seconds to load the main screen and several more for buffering the article.  There are oddly long pauses within narrations.  Between the title and author and beginning of the text there is a long pause and similarly so between paragraphs.  The pauses are long enough that I check my iphone to see if something is wrong.  Sometimes the audio has simply stopped playing.  I'm hoping that these problems are fixed in future updates.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Excellent content, pleasant playback and easy to use. This is how I like to consume media.  Saves your eyes and is less frenetic than other audiovisual sources of news. Hopefully more content coming soon to match the price. All in all, I'm hooked!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Not many titles included, and incredibly short trial period--3 days. Now I cannot end it so I may be automatically charged. (I followed instructions for stopping a subscription, but Audm isn't listed there.) The website has no support provided, and indicates no way to contact the developer. This should be reported to Apple and stopped.\nThe two articles I listened to, from the Atlantic, were very well narrated.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"When I heard about this app I was lukewarm on the idea. I don't have the patience to sit still and read longform articles in my daily life. But I like audiobooks so I thought I'd give it a try. Now I love this app. Its great to have these articles in audio form. I actually find myself opening up Audm more frequently than Audible. The performers are excellent and I can always find an article that interests me. I was also surprised that the app shows you a written version of the article in such an easy to follow along format. Very helpful.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I love this concept, love this app. The only thing that could make it better would be more content : Harper's , New Republic, New Yorker!? The Economist, Science mags?- please guys? Though it is reminding me that I've been missing Foreign Policy and ProPublica - I can't wait to see this app G-R-O-W!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This app is what I've been waiting for. I'm an adult with ADHD. It's hard for me to sit down and read long form publications because my mind won't let me focus on sentences without going into this rabbit hole of spin-off ideas about the writing, the positionality of the writer, the content, the blind spots in the perspective, and so on. It makes it hard to read often and read a lot. \n\nThis app helps me with all that. I can take in articles in a quarter of the time (thanks to double-time playback capabilities), which has made me feel so confident and well-read. I've struggled with achieving that feeling prior to his app because I'd barely get through one article in a day. Now, I just \"read\" 5 articles in an hour an fifteen minutes!\n\nIt's perfect for listening\/learning while cleaning, cooking, driving, or any other activity that takes your time but not your full attention. I see people have critiques about the price, which I get considering that there aren't many publications available just yet, but I'm trusting that the content will eventually expand. I also imagine that the developers are paying people money to read the articles so nicely, so I don't mind paying the $7 a month. 2 cups of Starbucks is not going to break my bank, even if I am currently unemployed. \n\nGet this. Pay for it, and be smarter for it.","category":"News","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"I love the concept behind this App. I listen to Podcasts constantly, and this fits right in with my news\/media consumption habits. I'm in the middle of the trial, and I'm really enjoying the content, the high quality of the reading, and the interface.  The Atlantic is what drew me in, and is definitely the content that I'm most drawn to here. That said, the subscription cost feels a bit high... I'd be happy to listen to some advertising, perhaps different subscription tiers could be introduced. I'm having a difficult time justifying paying to hear articles that are freely available to read with online advertising. Also, I'd love to see additional publications added, and the volume of content expand. The App itself is very attractive, though I have encountered some playback glitches. Love what you're doing and excited to see how it evolves. I want to subscribe after the trial ends, please make it worth it for me!!","category":"News","sentiment":"neutral"}

{"body":"As a big podcast\/audiobook fan I've been desperate for a way to listen to longform articles on my iPhone. Thank you, Audm! This app is exactly what I've been looking for! Instead of settling for the robot-Siri voice that reads back articles for me on other apps, Audm has some incredibly talented readers that really perform the stories. Plus the articles are all top notch -- consistently fascinating listens from the best journalists and publishers out there. Now anytime The Atlantic releases a new longform piece I'm eager to read, I head straight for my Audm app, where they've somehow already managed to post a beautiful recording of the same article. Love it! If you're a fan of podcasts, good journalism or storytelling, this is the app for you.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Did not know this even existed but there was a link from The Atlantic and instantly fell in love. Will be listening to a lot more and couldn't be more excited!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"$7 a month is a little too high, unless you're really into listening to stories you can read online! App is free with indication of in-app-purchase, but once you get the app you have to sign-up and you realize you have 3 days and you need to subscribe! Not worth it in my opinion.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app is sleek and easy to use. But more importantly, the quality of the audio and the stories are unmatched. I've discovered a number of new publishers through Audm.  They curate terrific content and I've come to trust their decisions in the stories they post. I hope they continue to grow!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The content is super with excellent selection of articles. The readers are good. However, the app needs a lot of work. It takes a long time to start and crashes frequently. Sometimes it will just stop reading for no reason. With a recent update I could nolonger sign in the app from iTunes. when I did the password reset, it tells me I have another account. There is no way to sign into the account from itunes to get to the restore screen.. so now I have a paid subscription that I can't access and a trial subscription at the same time. There is no app or subscriber support on the app or their website. Just a place to leave your contact info for the Android version. It would be wise for the developers to fix the iOs version first....","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I love the idea of this and the quality of the narrations is top notch. I subscribed about a week ago and cannot determine whether any new stories have been posted. The dates for articles say things like \"May 1st\" (2 weeks in the future) and there seems to be no way to sort by date. Most frustrating is that I cannot find any way to contact support. I'll discontinue my contract and try again at a later date.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"This app is a godsend, but it is buggy. It stops playing mid-article. Stops playing, as in you have to re-click the play button. And there's no assurance it will start again. It might just crash. Or do nothing. It also pauses for seconds, then starts again. And there's no way to know whether it will restart again, so you spend 10-20 seconds waiting for it to restart, which it might do, or you might have to interrupt what you are doing to restart it. It also crashes spontaneously. And- it'll hangs for >5 seconds. No button pressing works. It's just frozen. Then it starts working again. Or, it hangs for >5, then crashes.\n\nSad!\n\nThe audm idea is amazing. The implementation is very bad. If this could be reworked, audm could be a juggernaut of a service. Here's to waiting for that.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"The first item that I downloaded to listen to was dogged with playback errors. Just stopped playing about 6 times in an hour, I had to stop my run and restart. I couldn't search for the older content from the Atlantic which was the reason for downloading this app; you only get a short menu of current items. Not worth $7 a month with these limitations and problems.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Found this via reference in a publication I frequent, and was super impressed with this little app. It's everything you need and nothing you don't: great but manageable selection of stories expertly read. Great for morning showers, commutes, and the like!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Such a great idea. I'm an avid podcaster and reader. To be able to get Atlantic articles and other great content read to you while on the way to work is an idea that is ahead of its time. I can't subscribe to every magazine or read every article. So far I have enjoyed the wide variety of articles that Audm has placed in it's queue.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I'm a bit in line with the first reviewer - \"Where have you been . . . ?\" I'm 95+% an audio reader in just the last three years, a choice which has increased my book reading beyond my wildest expectations. Yet magazines and favorite journals were not in that loop - until I discovered Audm, a link for which was posted in an article on the New York Review of Books website. With investigation of the app, I was pleasantly surprised to find a number of my favorite journals available, a couple that were new to me, and a few I knew of but hadn't ever dipped into, such as the London Review of Books. I have other titles I'd love to suggest to Audm, but I'm sure they're working on that. The only downside I see is that the subscription will prove a bit too steep if I don't make regular use of the app. But I intend to!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"As an avid podcast listener and news consumer, I've always been on the look for a source of quality, long-form content and interesting stories. \n\nAudm brings together many of my favorite journalists from NYRB, Foreign Policy, and The Atlantic along with some amazing writers from magazines that I had never read before. I listen on my way to work, while out running, and at home while cooking. \n\nApp has simple (in a good way) UI and an unexpectedly pleasant feature where the text of the article scrolls while reading out loud. As someone who watched every episode of the West Wing with subtitles on, this scratches an itch I didn't expect. If you're a podcast fiend, news junkie, policy wonk, or just a fan of good stories, check it out.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"This is a GREAT idea: readings of current articles published by numerous sources of interest to me. \n\nBUT, and this is big, I can't always (ever) listen all the way through in one sitting. And not only does the app not hold my place, there's no way to scrub forward. SAD!","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"There are so many longform articles I save then never read as much don't have the time. I do have time to listen though, and Audm fills the gap. I happily subscribed immediately. \n\nAn improvement I'd suggest is tagging\/searching. I hope the quality continues as the breadth of resources grows! The readers are excellent, too.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I have long enjoyed listening to books, I love radio, and I was even an early fan of The Teaching Company and posses scores of their content from the 90s and early 2000s.  So when Audm popped up and it involved listening to magazine articles, it seemed a natural step to give it a try. It's a winner.  The length of the articles works very well for the commuter; most can be finished in a trip or two.  The articles are well-chosen and quite varied as to subject matter.  The narrators are excellent and also diverse enough that the listener ndoesn't get bogged down in distraction regarding vocal peculiarities, which can sometimes happen with audiobooks and podcasts. And the fact that the articles scroll along on your phone screen adds to the usefulness in that you have the ability to very easily go back and re-listen if you missed something or want to hear a section again.  My only small suggestion would be to decrease the pause time between paragraphs in the narration. Sometimes it goes an extra second or two and I wonder if I've lost the feed. But that's it.  Totally worth the subscription price.  I use it every single day.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

I religiously listen to the economist audio edition but was looking for something complementary that would cover a wider range of subjects from a range of publications, and Audm fits the bill.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I love listening to the articles on this app. As a busy, full time working mom I don't have time to read long story form journalistic pieces--and this allows me to do so on morning walks and while cleaning up around house and on my commute.

Keeps me informed and intellectually stimulated!","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

I don't like the clutter of magazines and newspapers, and reading articles on a computer screen is hard on my eyes, so it's great that I can listen to interesting material wherever I happen to be with my phone.

The eNewpaper opens in an internet browser (Safari), which is unlike the prior app, but that's ok once you get used to it.  I did have to experiment with touching the different buttons, so the user interface needs polishing.

{"body":"I love the idea of having an app for SOFREP. I love their site and read the articles mainly from my phone, so it only makes sense to have an app. This app is an utter disappointment. \n\nFirstly, every hyperlink and image on articles is overly sensitive; I find myself going to ad links three or four times per article when I was just trying to scroll down the page. Secondly, longer articles do no load in fully; the page glitches and stops only part of the way down making it impossible to read the full article. \n\nNext, the home page images are extremely slow to load, so it almost always appears that each article has the same image. \n\nFurthermore, SOFREP TV just doesn't work at all. None of the video and audio work, and generally if you click it, you'll be stuck at the loading page indefinitely. \n\nLastly, you cannot listen to audio while using the app. So much for listening to music while reading articles... Even if you're only reading articles and not using the unreliable SOFREP radio or attempting to use the broken SOFREP TV, it still shuts off your music the moment you open it. \n\nOverall, great idea but horrible execution. I hope they aren't paying someone to create\/manage it... it's garbage. \n\n-Mike OUT","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"After waiting months for Apple to fix its HORRIBLY flawed podcast app, I finally gave-up and started searching for an alternative. This app was not on my radar, but has been a good experience, so far. \n\nTHE GREAT: Unlike the native Apple App, it ACTUALLY WORKS!! What an AMAZING CONCEPT!! My CPU usage is finally down to a reasonable level and I haven\u2019t had a single crash in 24 hours.... My lifespan may actually increase thanks to my declining blood pressure! \n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT: I am still transitioning to this app, so I may have missed something, but #1). There doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to delete \u201cunplayed\u201d shows. As long as my phone\u2019s memory usage isn\u2019t high, that won\u2019t be a problem; I\u2019ll just have to ignore my compulsion to \u201cclean-up\u201d my podcast lists. #2). There doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to organize the podcasts into folders\/stations. On a positive note, you can \u201cmove\u201d the podcasts around, allowing you to keep similar topics together. Again, if these are the quirks that I\u2019ll have to tolerate to find a podcast app that ACTUALLY WORKS (and may actually add days to my life), I\u2019m OK with that!

This app does everything I need\/want it to do. Doesn\u2019t crash like the Apple Podcast app. Easy to control what\u2019s up next. Easy to search and has the past episodes","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I use this app a LOT.  If I\u2019m in my car, I probably have a podcast on.  Unfortunately, pausing the episode for more than a minute or two for any reason often kills the episode.\n\nIf I pause to make a phone call or send an email or stop in a store, I need to just find a different podcast.  The app does an auto-refresh in the background, and when I try to resume the episode it just says \u201cloading\u201d forever.  Only after listening to something else for a while can I resume the original episode.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

And if you wanted to listen to the podcasts you just spent the last few hours downloading (because to download you have to leave your screen on and open to the app,) not even a day earlier, then screw you, because this app has already removed all of them from your downloads! In addition, it\u2019s super slow if you didn\u2019t download, making this app basically worthless, and painful to use.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

Other apps I\u2019ve used only download the past 10-15 or so, so this is a big plus for for. I like the grid layout on the main page as well. My only gripes with the app is that isn\u2019t a universal settings page. I\u2019d like to change it where it doesn\u2019t play the next episode automatically, once the podcast is done I\u2019d like to either choose my next episode or just be done listening entirely. I also wish there was a dark mode as well, though that is purely cosmetic. It\u2019s a well thought out app and works amazingly, just wish there was a way to change a few settings app wide.","category":"News","sentiment":"neutral"}

As for d), I would like to be able to download a whole bunch of them to, go offline, and listen to them offline. \nIn addition, I would like to be able to save an episode without downloading it.\nNow it\u2019s quite possible that there\u2019s a way to do all of the things I mentioned, but as there\u2019s no FAQ or help center etc, I haven\u2019t been able to figure out how to do that.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

I do wish that there were settings for the user and I could customize the layout of the home listen screen, especially since I pay for the upgraded version with ads (SO WORTH IT!!). For example, I don\u2019t really care for the top line up of new shows, I already get notifications for that and the \u201cnew\u201d tag pops up on my podcasts when a new one is available. Also, like my second favorite app, Audible, I wish there was an option to change the background\/theme to \u201cmode\u201d or something.

Tony was no not that smooth and you could tell he was just learning his art. After a while he got better and the guest got better. What I like about this podcast the most is how real the guest are.Not the usual names you hear of people trying to sell the third and fourth book. But is it every day people who had extra ordinary experiences. Get the idea these people would not lie and have no intention or need to. It\u2019s everything from the metaphysical to the supernatural from folk that has experience it firsthand.I quickly started binge watching or listening to the podcast every day going home from work every day going to work until I caught up. It is quickly become my favorite podcast.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

Often fails to play, and if it does, does not respond to speed controls and forced to listen to articles in the very slow 1x speed. Sometimes an article cuts off in the middle and restarts itself.

{"body":"Images frequently don\u2019t load.\n\nCurrent week\u2019s content is usually available in the \"classic\" app before this one.\n\nArticle sections in weekly frequently have content from previous weeks. In some ways this is a good use of the Economist\u2019s wealth of articles, but more frequently I find myself going \"Wait, I\u2019ve read this before.\"\n\nSwiping between articles seems fiddly and unresponsive. I don\u2019t have this problem in similar apps, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s down to my device.\n\nOverall it\u2019s a good app on its own merits, but it has some failings around the weekly magazine that is a core part of the value of the Economist for many of us.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

I really like the layout of the app. I love the audio version of each article, especially since I am mildly dyslexic, it\u2019s truly opened me up to consumer so much more news each week.\n\nWhat I cannot understand is how the app can be so buggy and fail to work properly, even after so many updates. Sometimes the articles and audio player don\u2019t align properly in the app, sometimes the audio speed doesn\u2019t match what you set in the app. But my three biggest pet peeves are as follows:\n\n1.) The app does not respond to audio controls such as play\/pause from Bluetooth headphones\n2.) The app will not play over Bluetooth audio in my car\n3.) From time to time, the audio simply will not play, it\u2019s like the files got corrupted or cannot be read\n\nPlease please fix this, Economist. I would sorely like to enjoy your app every day, rather than wonder if it will work when I open it each morning.\n\nThank you.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

Finally learned today that it is because you can only view it on one device. This was NOT advertised when I purchased the app. In fact, I had purchased it on my iPhone while traveling but intended to read it more om my ipad. I am very frustrated that a) it took so long to figure this out and b) it was not advertised anywhere that obvious that I could see.

This review concerns only the apps from this publication, specifically on iPad)\n\nWhen the Economist recently (I think back in 2017) \u201cupdated\u201d their app, moving from paginated articles to more trendy, endlessly scrolling articles, I thought it was a huge step in the wrong direction. It looked like a cheap, generic app, with many bugs and shoddy UI. For instance, there was no way to jump to another section in one week\u2019s issue, and bookmarking was confusing. \n\nI still miss pagination on iPad (call me old fashioned but I think this is the best way to present magazine articles), but this new app version is a vast improvement. Better look, better UI, easy bookmarks that sync between iPad and iPhone. Jump to sections easily. Daily content in addition to the weekly issues. Easy audio downloads. \n\nWith that said, I highly recommend this app.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

The rewrite has succeeded in transforming the app from a digital version of the weekly newspaper into a full fledged source of news, catering not only to the times I feel like reading in-depth analysis from the issue\u2019s front to back. The linked articles at the end of each article allow me to wander around and read based on topic even if the linked articles are from a previous issue.

This is a huge advantage over other podcast player apps. \n\nI just had to get this out. There\u2019s more reasons to switch to or choose this app but I\u2019ll check bac later.\n\nUPDATE: on the newest release I can go to .8 playback speed but not .9\n\nThis is ridiculous because nobody needs a wide a range rather a more incremental speed control. \n\nI rolled back a few versions to get the ability to playback at .9\n\n:-)\n\nStill my favorite still the best in my book.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

Totally understand at beginning and end, but plzzzzz edit the amount DURING the podcast). Castbox is my preferred podcast listening app. The boost sound and individualized speed are SUPER SEXY additions!!! I would have given a 5 star rating if there were limitless pods that could be saved (a recent and NEGATIVE adjustment-if I want to OD on podcasts, that is my decision). Also, about a 1\/2-1\/3 of my saved podcasts don\u2019t automatically refresh\/have notifications for new episodes- (the other half does). I will click on a podcast and there will be 1-3 new episodes. I would  like to see a more diverse selections of podcasts added to the suggestions- overkill on the mainstream suggestions.

Really, a dream to navigate, and a very clean interface. \n\nAnd this to me is the mark of a great podcast app, because all of them have basically the same features.

This is something that always frustrated me with Apple Podcasts. If I want to play the episode in Castbox without opening it\u2019s description, I can also just tap the tab on the left side of the episode bar and it begins playing immediately.

At first I thought this was a specific podcast\u2019s issue, but I eventually noticed it happening in other podcast feeds as well.\n-It has happened on occasion that I subscribe to a podcast and it doesn\u2019t appear at all in my subscriptions until I restart my phone. Not sure why these issues occur, but they\u2019re very frustrating to deal with when Apple Podcasts shows me the latest episodes, and I\u2019m like, I wanna listen in Castbox to stay up to date in there!\n-If I arrange my podcast with the newest episodes at the top of the list, the app will play the retroconsecutive episodes regardless of their \u201cPlayed 100%\u201d status. I wish the app would recognize already played episodes and stop plying if the entire podcast library has been played.\nUpdate Suggestions:\n-It would be great to be able to tell the app whether to play continuously through the list of episodes or just play one individual episode.\n-Having a customizable playlist section to setup 10 episodes from different podcasts would make this THE top notch podcast app for road trips. I haven\u2019t looked into premium yet, and assume this is probably included there. I would probably subscribe to premium services if that was a feature, because that would be amazing to have a customized playlist that just plays without me switching between podcasts on the road when I\u2019m driving back home.\nAlso would love to set subscriptions to my main page when the app opens. I go to Discover occasionally, but mainly just want my personalized feed. Perhaps this is also in Premium?\nThe best podcast app that needs work. That\u2019s my final rating. Hoping to update my rating to 5 stars! I really do love the app, but it has a couple issues I just can\u2019t look past.","category":"News","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I enjoy this app. I like that it gives suggestions based off the podcasts you already listen to.

{"body":"I had such high hopes for this app. Literally every podcast I listen to has recommended it specifically. But no matter what I seem to do, it just keeps pausing. Every 5-10 seconds. Doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m on WiFi or LTE. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s an open WiFi network or my workplace\u2019s super fast encrypted WiFi. It. Just. Does. Not. Work.\n\nI have gripes about the stock \u2018Podcast\u2019 iOS app, but it never, and I mean NEVER pauses like this. When I had to re-download the stock app to finish an episode I\u2019m trying to get through, that was when I was done with trying to make this app work. Deleted.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"So much to like about this app but there are several key issues which need to be addressed especially for a premium app. \n\nThe biggest and most important is that the app has trouble picking up new episodes and showing them in the new releases section. Maybe it\u2019s because I have a lot of subscriptions but I went through my shows individually and found seven new episodes that the app had not surfaced. Of all the features a podcast app must get right, this is number one. Until this is fixed, I can\u2019t recommend people trust the app. \n\nSecondly, if you share the link to an episode and the person opens it on a computer, they get a nice web interface to listen in. This is a great way to share and to get people curious about the app. Unfortunately, they\u2019ve taken the opposite tactic on mobile. If some one open the link on their phone it forces then to download the app. This is just bad user experience. I can promise that no one ends up downloading the app from a tactic like this. This just click out of the link and never listen to the episode. And as almost 100% of what we share is opened on a phone not a desktop, this makes the user stop sharing. I have. Make the web app available on mobile browsers. More people will share and hence more people will know about castbox.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"*SEE UPDATE AT END OF REVIEW*\n\nSince the native iPhone podcast app went all higgledy piggledy, I have been on the hunt for a replacement. I think Castbox may be it... easy to use, large selection, etc. however, on the last update it lost all my subscriptions. I now have the fun task of repopulating my subscriptions. First world problem, I get it. Still annoying. If the issue does not repeat, I\u2019ll bump the rating up; if it does, I\u2019ll drop it and continue the hunt.\n\n*UPDATE*\nThe developer has been amazing responding to my concern.

I do wish there were a more intuitive way to add specific episodes of podcasts to the playlist without having to click on each episode and then click the \u201cadd\u201d icon, but it\u2019s not annoying enough to deny the developers a well-deserved rating.

But I am alarmed by the fact that my \u201cListen\u201d tab is constantly full of suggestions for podcasts from extremists like Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson and even hate group leader Gavin McInnis. I have no idea why I am getting these suggestions. I\u2019m not interested in or subscribed to any podcasts that are remotely political or ideological, not to mention the kind of vile and hateful content I\u2019m seeing suggested. In fact I doubt it is based on my subscriptions at all, because I was seeing these things when I first downloaded the app before subscribing to anything. I am a strong supporter of free speech, so I think if people want to listen to hate speech they should be free to do so. But I find it appalling that these things are pushed on people like myself who have zero interest in them. I literally see it every time I open the app. Even a simple \u201chide - not interested\u201d option would be great, but I\u2019m not seeing one.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

I feel that anywhere I see the title of a podcast I should be able to add it to the playlist with a single tap without opening up another screen \u2014\u2022\n\nUpdate - I've been using it now for about a week. There are definitely a few things I've noticed that could use improvement (I won't be switching away yet however):\n\n1. If play gets interrupted while the screen is off, the play button on the lock screen does not start play again. I have to unlock the phone & open the app & press play. Very inconvenient, especially whilst driving or working. \n\n2. Unable to rearrange podcasts in the \"Subscribed\" section. I even started the 7 day free trial hoping that that option would be available therein. No such luck so I shan't renew for the paid app. This, to me and many others (judging from multiples of reviews) is an essential function.\n\n3. To me there are too many steps to add a podcast to a playlist. Anywhere I see the title of a playlist I feel there should be the option to add a podcast to a playlist. And for that matter - I can reorder the podcasts in the playlist so I know you guys know how to include that function. \n\n4. When I add a podcast to the playlist autoplay still plays the next podcast in the \"Subscribed\" list. ***Or it plays the next podcast in that individual podcast titles list*** So again I have to unlock my phone, open the app and select the next podcast in the playlist. \n\u2022 This negates the usefulness of having a playlist. \n\u2022 This also negates the usefulness of being able to arrange the order\n\u2022 This also makes me scratch my head and mutter, \"why can I arrange a list who's order is meaningless yet I can't arrange the list who's order actually is relevant?\" And people all around me look at me and wonder why I'm muttering about lists...\n\n5. This is minor - it's slower to load audio than the Apple podcast app. Don't know why & it's not a deal-breaker but it is certainly noticable. \n\nOther than those 4 main issues I still prefer this app. If these things don't get addressed in future updates though I will end up going looking for an app that doesn't have these omissions. It is definitely quite inconvenient to have to keep opening the app at the end of almost every podcast. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nLike everyone else here I got tired of the Apple app and searched for a new one in the middle of an app, just 2 minutes ago so this is an incomplete review. \n\nFirst thing I want to say which I haven't seen mentioned anywhere and I'm glad it's an included feature - It Has Night Mode! Thank goodness for that. \n\nNow, the one problem I have (& I want to be clear - I read about a dozen reviews and their responses so I went through pretty much all the tabs and settings, which is how I found Night Mode) is that I went into playlists both in the app and 3D touch. \n\nIt says that I have nothing in playlists and below that it says add an episode now! Tapping as\nAdd now does nothing. There's no + symbol, there's no list of my subscribed podcasts with a + symbol next to it - it's just a blank page. That's curious. \n\nHaving read a bunch of reviews I feel pretty confident that I'll get an answer here and that fact on and of itself is probably the main reason why I downloaded the app even though I wasn't sure if it had Night Mode. \n\nOther than that - so far so good \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude01","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I am a serious podcast listener and when I imported in just a fraction of the shows I subscribe to, I knew immediately that this app was not built for me. The podcasts display with no discernible organizational scheme, and after having to google organization (because it\u2019s not intuitive) it seems that podcasts can only be sorted by last update\u2014even alphabetical is not available. There is also not way to organize playlists by category, which is a vital option when you have well over a hundred podcasts that you listen to. At the very least, having the option to sort podcasts alphabetically is essential when you like to listen to backlogs, or prefer to save podcasts for a certain mood or task. This seems like it was built for algorithms, not practical human use. \n\nMaybe its suggestion algorithm and search are great, but the UI is unusable for me.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Really wanted to like this app. Mostly because some podcasts I listen to are partnered with Castbox, so it would benefit them to listen through Castbox instead of Apple Podcasts. Anyway, here is why I am going back to Apple podcast and deleting Castbox:\n1.) If you\u2019re in the car and listening to a podcast on Castbox, the podcast will not pause during the Maps instructions. So you can count on every 1-3 mins missing about 5 words of what your podcast is saying if you\u2019re not on the highway. I looked through the settings and couldn\u2019t find a way to pause the podcast during Map instructions. \n2.) First two pages are \u201cdiscover pages\u201d. I like the \u201cSubscribed\u201d but it would be nice if the \u201cListen\u201d page showed your recently updated podcasts. Also, \u201cSubscribed\u201d is not in order from most recent uploads, so it\u2019s easy to miss a new podcast if you don\u2019t scroll down and look for the tiny orange \u201c1\u201d. Also, if you want to change the discover page or anything you have to pay. \n\nOverall, good app but is not a replacement for Apple podcasts. You don\u2019t have to pay for Apple Podcasts, and you don\u2019t have to discover new podcasts unless you want to. In app purchases is a no-go considering podcasts are free","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"One suggestion: I would love to have the downloads, when ordered by channel, to be in a chronological order and not in the order in which I downloaded it. Or to be able to switch between chronological and order of download.

{"body":"I\u2019ve searched for a good podcast platform and so far this is my favorite\nHowever, it\u2019s missing obvious features that may push me to continue my search.\n\nFor example: there are no settings to be able to change the play settings. No option to choose skip forward or backward time. Most apps let me choose between 15 and 30 seconds. It also has no option for me to turn off the auto play next episode. This one drives me crazy\n\nIt also does something super funky when you share an episode with others - it shares the image of the podcast, then the title, then the link so it looks like I\u2019ve just sent 3 separate obnoxious texts to someone instead of just the link which includes all of that data anyway\n\nFinally, I wish that when I click on listen, the page below my options for downloaded, playlist, and new releases that it listed my subscriptions there instead of a separate tab. It feels counter intuitive and I\u2019m still getting used to the strange navigation.\n\nWhy I\u2019m using this one over other apps - it\u2019s a cleaner design, has the sleep timer, playlist etc.\nThe main game changer - this is the only app I could find that let me mark something as played without downloading the episode first or playing it and skipping it to the end and letting it play out.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

It gets 3 stars for doing what it needs to do in a fast, responsive manner.\n\nBut...it is focused on discovery, opening to a feed of new podcasts to listen to.  Playlists have to be built manually.  It just lacks features i have gotten used to on other apps.  Smart playlists, smart audio boost, auto download new episodes, custom number of episodes to do so.\n\nOverall, i might have even given this 4 stars if the app prioritized me listening to my podcasts over discovery.

{"body":"I initially downloaded this app and said I would give it two weeks using it every day before I review it. So far I have thoroughly enjoyed every episode I\u2019ve listened to and I am definitely going to use this for a long time. It has so many great podcasts and interesting recommendations that I\u2019ve really enjoyed. I was able to link it to my google account which is always a bonus. The only negative would be that it is unable to connect with my Alexa or Chrome-cast. I really enjoy listening to podcasts when I\u2019m around my house and I only have one set of Bluetooth compatible speakers that are already linked with my Alexa. Disconnecting them just to link to my phone is obviously not the end of the world but being able to shift between CastBox and other apps is always appreciated (and would bump this review to 5\/5 stars). I mean this in the same way that I can toggle with Pandora and Spotify.

{"body":"I really want to love this app, since it\u2019s so much better than Apple Podcasts. However in the last week or so anytime I try to press the play button, nothing happens. This includes any play or action button on the screen. Sometimes I can\u2019t even select the Subscription or Details buttons either. Fix this please!","category":"News","sentiment":"neutral"}

It keeps you updated on new legislation, Trump rallies, Presidential memoranda & proclamations, promises made and their progress, educates you about who is in the President\u2019s cabinet and links to their Twitter accounts, provides election forecasts, allows you to participate in hot-topic polls, AND it enables you to contact the president directly. You get a lot for your ninety-nine cents, and it\u2019s worth every penny. This app is a must for every Trump supporter. You won\u2019t be disappointed.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"My father taught me the greatest measure of a man is his word, if you cannot trust a man by what he says he will do then you can never trust him for any reason, President Trump told the American people what he was going to do as president and that's exactly what he has done. My father said a man's word is his bond, it defines him as to what type a man he is and it defines him as a great man, his word is gold.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

You have to pay and that\u2019s not much of a problem to me but for the people who can\u2019t spend money on apps...you know, I just think everyone should be able to access this app. I personally think it\u2019s important to stay updated on politics and I know you can watch the news or something but this app tells you EVERYTHING. Well, not absolutely everything but still. So in conclusion, my point is this app should be free for everyone. I hope you take this message into consideration.

{"body":"Listened to a few shows hoping to learn and sharpen my arguments.  The hosts kept saying that x, y, or z were debunked.  Apparently they think that saying something is debunked is the same as debunking something.  Very disappointing.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I am giving this a 5-star rating to support TYT because I believe in their vision. The app could use some improvements though. For example rewinding\/fast forwarding is glitchy and inaccurate on the app. This is frustrating. If the app saved where you left off a show, and I could just pick up where I left off, this might be less of a nuisance. Also, both the app and the site should have the live content immediately available to watch. If I miss the first hour, I don\u2019t want to have to wait until the next day to go back and watch the best bits, especially as a member. In this fast paced news cycle 2 dozen new things have happened overnight. Also, and this isn\u2019t so much app related, but make video of No Filter with Ana Kasparian available on the rewatch! Having it in audio only form isn\u2019t as good.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"The live video playback efficiency needs improvement. Even on a great Wi-Fi connection it often gives up on video and just plays the audio, or it prebuffers FOREVER. Very frustrating.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"Terrible app with horrible basically non existent support!TYt videos rarely download so you can view at your leisure making it useless if you want to listen on the go without eating up your cell data\u2014the main reason I am a subscriber.TYT staff seems to assume everyone is tech saavy and are in their own bubble on this topic.I am aghast that they don\u2019t even have a you tube video to show how to use their apps particularly if they want to attract older viewers.Again they assume  everyone is tech saavy-I have asked friendsin their twenties to help and they don\u2019t know how!!","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

{"body":"I love the app! I drive a ton for work (I'm a trucker) and so I always listen to the podcasts on the road. The problem comes when I have to pause the podcast to pick it up later in the day. Most of the time unless I start it back up within 5 or 10 minutes of stopping, it loses my place in the podcast so I have to fast forward until I find the right spot.","category":"News","sentiment":"neutral"}
{"body":"I love and begin my every day watching yesterday's episode of The Young Turks. The show is great & having access to all the shows on the network is great. The app looks great and is easy to use, but leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nFirst: there needs to be a way to save your place in a video so you can leave and come back to it. The lack of any sort of bookmark feature is especially glaring on a phone, where numerous interruptions pop up regularly.\n\nNext, there needs","category":"News","sentiment":"neutral"}

If you missed the live feed you can watch it the very next morning. It takes time for some one to edit the content then post the video. If I want to watch the live show then I need to make sure to open the app and just watch the show while it is showing live. Just like I do when I want to watch any sporting event or other live feeds.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"I love TYT!!  By accident I started watching videos on YouTube and became a fan!  I have been introduced to so much from TYT and now I love All the shows.  Cenk, Anna are my heroes!  Jimmy Dore is also awesome, love his shows!  Any ways I have been so ignorant about politics because mainstream media keeps you nice and miss informed.  In my humble opinion if we were not so miss informed about the real truth we would never be in so much trouble.  I now look for independent media, there is so much info out there but truth is hard to find.  I identify myself with the left when it comes with politics.  Being poor my whole life, dealing with the difficult of leaving my home country and being a woman who always work hard, and was not be able to afford college was not easy.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"My boyfriend bought my membership for my birthday and I excitedly downloaded the app and a couple of the podcasts. I have to listen to the podcasts in spurts because of time\/work constraints, and every time it\u2019s paused for more than a couple minutes my spot is lost. It doesn\u2019t play for a while and it takes time to buffer even though I have it downloaded? But then I have to find my place all over again. Every time. Please... please fix it. I really wish there was a way to sync my Apple podcast app history with this app so I could pickup where I left off on some past episodes, but I know that\u2019s not going to happen.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}
{"body":"I\u2019m sorry tyt, I love y\u2019all and all your shows are amazing but your app is crap. It\u2019s not updated very well; I can find some the podcasts on apple podcasts faster than it updates on your app. Member content should be updated first! Also, if you start a video in the app and then exit out it will sometimes start over from the beginning...come on tyt! You have almost two hour long videos and now I have to go and try and find my place? The video should start where you left off, same goes for podcasts. \nFinally, IF we are going to have to find our places there should at least be high speed scrubbing where it shows you the timestamp of where you are at in the video while you looking for it. \n\nTyt you deserve 5 stars, as the home of progressives you all produce wonderful content. But seriously, for all your members, bring your app into 2019.","category":"News","sentiment":"negative"}

They are intelligent and very insightful. Cenk has a kind of relaxed attitude and a sense of humor, while reporting up to the minute progressive news. \n\nMembership has additional features and helps support independent news networks. Mon-Fri from 6-8 EST TYT is on live. I try to watch daily.  If you\u2019re on the fence, why not watch for free and decide if supporting progressive independent is for you.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}

{"body":"I\u2019ve had this app for months now and have never had any issues. These reviews about bugs and stuff have all been addressed. When the live show releases it plays through YouTube live so you can rewind it. I will say that the upload The show pretty late in the evening about 7 or 8 PM. However, though that\u2019s how I prefer it. I am a full-time student and work a part-time job so I am pretty busy until the evening so it works out perfect. What I will say though is I do wish that there would be a comment system implemented.","category":"News","sentiment":"positive"}
{"body":"Unless you listen all the way through, Apple tends to close apps in the background.  Most audio apps will save where you paused.  Not this app.  You start at the beginning and have to figure out where you paused.
